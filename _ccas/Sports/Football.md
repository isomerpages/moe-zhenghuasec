<p>Football CCA provides students with opportunities to develop their skills,
character, and passion for the sport. Through structured training and competitive
play, students build technical abilities such as passing, dribbling, defending,
and teamwork, while also cultivating resilience, discipline, and sportsmanship.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Football CCA matters because football is more than just a game—it nurtures
important values and life skills. Students learn perseverance in the face
of challenges, the importance of mutual support, and the ability to remain
composed under pressure. These lessons prepare them not only for competition
but also for real-life situations beyond school.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Key features of the CCA include regular training sessions focused on skill
development, friendly matches, and participation in the National School
Games. These experiences ensure that students remain engaged, motivated,
and match-ready.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through the Football CCA, students grow into confident individuals, responsible
leaders, and supportive teammates, carrying lessons that extend well beyond
the pitch.</p>
