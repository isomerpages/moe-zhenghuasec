<p>Outdoor Adventure Club (ODAC) is a co-curricular activity that brings
students out of their comfort zone and provides opportunities for students
to explore the outdoors through activities such as hiking, camping, kayaking,
rock climbing, and other team-based adventure challenges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our CCA nurtures resilience, leadership, and teamwork. It encourages students
to face physical and mental challenges. Students develop growth mindset
and adaptive thinking when problem solving. ODAC also promotes teamwork,
perseverance, and self-confidence. These qualities are essential in both
school and life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ODAC conducts a range of outdoor activities and expeditions throughout
the year. Signature programmes include hikes, orienteering (navigation
training), and high elements. These are designed to progressively build
students’ skills, confidence, and camaraderie in real world outdoor settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through active participation in ODAC, students gain valuable life skills
such as problem-solving, leadership, teamwork, and adaptability. They become
more self-reliant, resilient, and confident in facing challenges.</p>
