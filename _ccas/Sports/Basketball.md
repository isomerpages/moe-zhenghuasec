In Basketball, our boys pride themselves on training diligently twice a week, focusing on ball-handling skills, footwork, defensive and offensive formation play. Even though our yearly friendly matches and competitions have been postponed due to Covid-19, the players have continued to build their stamina through physical conditioning training held over Zoom e-CCA sessions. The continuation of these sessions have provided opportunities for our boys to continue strengthening their bonds with each other as we recognize that building camaraderie is the bedrock for good team play. As the Covid situation improves, our boys will continue to train their physical fitness and mental discipline as they eagerly await their return to the court!

#### Activities

Our basketball boys and teachers-in-charge form a very tightly-knit group. The boys work hard towards the training direction set by the teachers, focusing on their personal mastery, as well as team play design, to improve their effectiveness and strengths. They also adhere closely to the fitness and diet programmes the teachers drew up to help them grow physically.

They believe in reaching out to the community and played their part in our school Zest celebration. They put up a game booth that was crowded throughout the Zest event and thoroughly enjoyed themselves while engaging the public.
