<p>Here at Zhenghua Volleyball, our student athletes are given the opportunities
to develop and hone their skills and values that are fundamental to their
growth as a volleyball player, a student and a young adult.</p>
<p>Our trainings do not just focus on refining skills. Special emphasis is
placed on educating our players about respect, discipline, resilience,
and teamwork. These qualities, essential both on and off the court, push
our volleyball players to be the best versions of themselves.</p>
<p>The school team has been actively participating in various inter-school
tournaments and organising frequent friendly games to challenge our players,
expose them to other volleyball communities and provide them the opportunity
to excel. We also offer mentorship opportunities for the senior players
to coach their juniors too.</p>
<p>Above all, Zhenghua Volleyball represents sportsmanship, camaraderie and
a hunger for success that lasts well beyond our students’ schooling years.</p>
