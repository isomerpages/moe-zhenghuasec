##### 2018		 

The goals and objectives of the team is to develop the passion for the netball game in our players and most importantly to also instill the importance of our school values such as Compassion, Integrity, Responsibility, Resilience and Respect in our players. The team also aims to develop self-discipline, team spirit and good sportsmanship in our play.

The team started the year with the B and C division team participating in the 2018 West Zone Netball Tournament. The team showed great resilience in their play. The competitive zonal tournament gave the teams the boost they needed to compete in the M1 Schools Challenge League 2018.

The team also got to participate in various friendly matches and carnivals, such as the Neptops Carnival and Springfield Carnival.
