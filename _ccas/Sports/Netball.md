<p>Our school's Netball CCA is a dynamic sports programme that nurtures both
competitive excellence and character development. Through structured training
sessions and competitive play, students develop fundamental netball skills
while fostering teamwork and leadership abilities.</p>
<p>The programme aims to cultivate not just skilled players, but well-rounded
individuals who embody sportsmanship and resilience. Students learn valuable
life skills such as time management, goal setting, and working effectively
in a team—competencies that serve them well beyond the court.</p>
<p>Training sessions are conducted twice weekly, focusing on technical skills,
tactical gameplay, and physical conditioning. Players participate in various
competitions, including the National School Games, Carnivals and friendly
matches with other schools. Our experienced coach emphasises both individual
skill development and team strategies.</p>
