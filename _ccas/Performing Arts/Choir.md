2019 was a significant and memorable year for the school choir. One main event in the choir calendar was the SYF Arts Presentation. As a part of our preparations, the choristers participated in the Choral Exchange at Serangoon Garden Secondary School.  _ZEST_ was another key event for us. We embarked on a fund-raising project; we sold notebooks that were painted and handmade by us.

We gamely participated in the National Day school concert. The choristers sang a medley of traditional National Day songs which included ‘Home’ and ‘We Will Get There’. We also led the audience in the singing of the national anthem.

Yet another significant programme was the CIP _at_ Bo Tien Day Activity Centre. The choir sang several folk songs and bonded with the seniors there through story-telling and a game of bingo.
