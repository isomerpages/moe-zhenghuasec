#### Activities:		 

A unique Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) in Zhenghua Secondary School, the Handbells Ensemble consists of dedicated members who enjoy playing different songs by ringing handbells and handchimes. After taking part in the school aesthetics production, Tapestry: When New Meets Old last year along with other performing arts groups, we gained more confidence to perform in the recent Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) 2019 Arts Presentation. After months of practice under the guidance of our handbells instructor, Mr Myren Mak, we grew in confidence and skill, playing two songs, ‘Waltz Fantasy’ and ‘Caprice’, well in the recent SYF. Our great teamwork and commendable effort won us the Certificate of Accomplishment this year.
