#### Zhenghua Dance Club

In Dance Club, our dancers are being trained in both Streetdance and Malay Contemporary Dance. Our members are a team of energetic youth who find joy in expressing their thoughts and feelings through choreographed and freestyle dance moves. Every single member is committed to giving his best to the Club and that is key to us obtaining the various accolades over the years.

Apart from developing technical dance skills through practices twice a week, our dance programme includes performing for various school and public performances and competitions, creating self-choreographed routines as well as participating in learning journeys to watch and appreciate live and online performances of other dance companies. In addition, opportunities for leadership development are also available as our dancers can take up different leadership roles such as Executive Committee members of the Club, Dance Captains and Level Leaders.

Dance Club is proudly helmed by celebrated dance instructors Mr Osman Abdul Hamid and Mr Alif Aircho.
