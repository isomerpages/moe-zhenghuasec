#### Achievements

**SYF 2021 - Certificate of Accomplishment**

Zhenghua Secondary Concert Band is an inclusive music CCA which welcomes students who are interested to learn music and band instruments regardless of their musical backgrounds. With the patient support of our conductors and teachers, we aim to help our students advance their music performance abilities and cultivate a deep appreciation and understanding of the arts.

Despite SMM restrictions on wind instrument CCA practices, we persisted in our training sessions by having Zoom practice sessions and even practices at open air locations with adequate safe distancing to prepare for the SYF Arts Presentation. The instructors also adopted online lessons, quizzes and apps to support the learning of our new members while keeping lessons interesting and varied.

Through our efforts, we continue to strive for excellence and showcase riveting performances that will cheer and comfort our audiences in these trying times.

**SYF 2019 â€“ Certificate of Accomplishment**

Established in 2000, the Zhenghua Secondary School Band was set up with the intention to nurture young individuals with a passion in music.

Learning to read and play music may seem very difficult at first, but it is a worthwhile journey for all our band members. The band is dedicated to spreading the love and joy for music. We love participating in concerts and ViA activities and organising band exchanges with other schools. Also, we not only play music by classical and modern musicians, but we also learn how to play famous pop songs from all over the world!

We are not only about playing music but also experiencing music. We go on learning journeys to watch how professional musicians perform on stage and learn how different theatres are created to enhance the music we listen to.

We are not only a band, but a family too. We always stick to our motto: One Band, One Sound.

The band hopes to be able to continue to share their love for music with the school and community in the years to come.
