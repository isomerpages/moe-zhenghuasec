<h4>Achievements:</h4>
<p>SYF 2019 Arts Presentation â€“ Certificate of Accomplishment</p>
<p>The Drama Club achieved a Certificate of Accomplishment at SYF Arts Presentation
2019 with a performance centred on the theme of special needs. The club
worked hard on their roles to portray the challenges faced by people with
special needs in an impactful way. Through the process of preparing for
the presentation, the actors, who were committed to put up an exemplary
performance, honed their acting skills and grew more united as a club.</p>
<p>The Drama Club also had the opportunity to do a Values-in-Action project
in partnership with Bo Tien Day Activity Centre. Students planned the activities
for the visit to the centre and had a rich learning experience interacting
with the elderly there.</p>
