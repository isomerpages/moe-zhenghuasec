#### Achievements:

SYF 2019 Arts Presentation â€“ Certificate of Accomplishment

The Drama Club achieved a Certificate of Accomplishment at SYF Arts Presentation 2019 with a performance centred on the theme of special needs. The club worked hard on their roles to portray the challenges faced by people with special needs in an impactful way. Through the process of preparing for the presentation, the actors, who were committed to put up an exemplary performance, honed their acting skills and grew more united as a club.

The Drama Club also had the opportunity to do a Values-in-Action project in partnership with Bo Tien Day Activity Centre. Students planned the activities for the visit to the centre and had a rich learning experience interacting with the elderly there.
