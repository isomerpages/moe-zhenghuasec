##### 2017

Chingay 2017 with the Malay Contigent - Best in Contingent Display Award

For the very first time, the Drums Ensemble and the Scouts’ Chinese Drums collaborated during the school’s Chinese New Year celebrations to usher in the Lunar New Year with much glee and aplomb. Entitled ‘Harmony in Diversity’, the spectacular performance conveyed the joy of our diverse communities in a novel way.

Our drummers enchanted the audience at ‘Pantang Nenek Moyang Aku’, a Malay cultural event held at the newly-built Wisma Geylang Serai on the 10th of March. It was certainly an exhilarating experience for the maiden public performers especially!

Members of the ensemble also worked hand in hand with Bo Tien Day Activity Centre _for the Elderly_ for our annual VIA this year. The drummers interacted well with the residents at the centre through the _Malay kompang_ and they demonstrated their skills at forming ‘rabbits’ with handkerchiefs.

Other than public stages, the Drums Ensemble also shares the joy of drumming with the school during school events! Our secondary 1 drummers made their debut when they performed during Awards Day. The drummers continue to develop their drumming skills as well as building greater self-confidence with our upcoming programmes and activities, such as the Annual Drums Camp and various workshops.
