##### Achievements:

*   Invited to present at NLB’s Get Lit!: An Educator's Guide to Sparking the Reading Joy

##### Activities

We were really proud that our library was selected by the National Library Board to share our key reading programmes at the inaugural poster session of the Get Lit!: An Educator’s Guide to Sparing Reading Joy event. We shared our popular Blind Date with a Book and our new event for 2019 – New Books Launch for our top readers. The New Books Launch event received a lot of positive feedback!

The club also put in tremendous effort to put up a unique art and craft stall for Zest. All the members put in extra hours just to do our little bit for charity and to celebrate our school’s 20th anniversary. It really helped us to bond together as we learnt how to work together as a team to produce something special within such a short time frame. It was tiring but we really treasure the team spirit.

“Shopping for books at Kinokuniya was really fun because I had the privilege to choose new books for the library. I hope I get the chance to go again to buy more books that my schoolmates would like to read.”
