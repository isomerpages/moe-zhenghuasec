| The Infocomm Club started off 2017 fruitfully by honing <br>their skills in videography, video <br>editing, Photoshop skills and photography. | <img src="/images/infocomm%201.jpg" style="width:65%">Interacting with our schoolmates at our National Day carnival booth |
| The students participated in the Singapore Digital<br> Media Awards (SDMA). This year, to<br> further challenge themselves, the<br> members participated in two <br>categories:  Video and Photo Essay.<br> The students worked hard to<br> produce an original video that<br> takes a closer look at the issue<br> of cyberbullying. The video even <br>starred one of the teachers-in<br>-charge, Mr Koh Eng Huat, who<br> plays a villainous principal! | <img src="/images/infocomm%202.jpg" style="width:55%">Behind the scenes of our SDMA video about cyberbullying |
| The Photo Essay team spent a <br>productive day at Sungei Buloh<br> Nature Reserve over the March<br> holidays. Besides soaking in<br> the tranquil environment, the<br> team captured some beautiful <br>shots of this paradise on earth, <br>depicting their message of the<br> importance of conservation of <br>Singapore’s natural environment.|<img src="/images/infocomm%203.jpg" style="width:55%">The SDMA Photojournalism group taking shots at Sungei Buloh |
