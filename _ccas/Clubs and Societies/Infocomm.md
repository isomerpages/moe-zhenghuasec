<p>The Infocomm Club is a dynamic CCA that equips students with cutting-edge
digital skills through three specialised pathways: Photography, Digital
Media Production, and Artificial Intelligence. Our programme develops technical
proficiency and creative thinking as students master industry-standard
tools and emerging technologies under the guidance of professional trainers.
Members gain hands-on experience by documenting school events, creating
multimedia content, and developing AI solutions for real-world problems.
Through participation in prestigious national competitions and learning
journeys to tech companies, students connect classroom knowledge with industry
practices. Our signature activities include photography workshops at iconic
locations, AI programming bootcamps, and collaborative projects that challenge
students to innovate. Students graduate with a robust portfolio of technical
skills, competition experience, and the confidence to excel in Singapore's
digital economy. The club nurtures not just technical competency, but also
leadership, teamwork, and problem-solving abilities essential for future
success.</p>
