| The Infocomm Club started off 2017 fruitfully by honing <br>their skills in videography, video <br>editing, Photoshop skills and photography. | <img src="/images/infocomm%201.jpg" style="width:65%">|
| The students participated in the Singapore<br> Digital Media Awards (SDMA). This year, to<br> further challenge themselves, the<br> members participated in two <br>categories:  Video and Photo Essay.<br> The students worked hard to<br> produce an original video that<br> takes a closer look at the issue<br> of cyberbullying. The video even <br>starred one of the teachers-in<br>-charge, Mr Koh Eng Huat, who<br> plays a villainous principal! | <img src="/images/infocomm%202.jpg" style="width:95%"> |
| The Photo Essay team spent a <br>productive day at Sungei Buloh<br> Nature Reserve over the March<br> holidays. Besides soaking in<br> the tranquil environment, the<br> team captured some beautiful <br>shots of this paradise on earth, <br>depicting their message of the<br> importance of conservation of <br>Singapore’s natural environment.|<img src="/images/infocomm%203.jpg" style="width:95%"> |
|The club also contributes to various <br>school events by sending out<br> student videographers, capturing<br> the spirit of each moment.|<img src="/images/infocomm%204.jpg" style="width:95%"> |
| The Infocomm Club offers various<br> engaging modules where members<br> gain valuable and relevant ICT <br>skills. The club contributes actively<br> to various school programmes <br>and events by being budding <br>photographers and videographers. Each member is<br> involved in the pre-production, production, and post-production process. |<img src="/images/infocomm%205.jpg" style="width:95%">
