##### Activities:

The AVA Club provides audio-visual support for the daily running of the school as well as during school concerts and events. This year, apart from morning assemblies, our members facilitated the smooth flow of the Chinese New Year Concert, Awards Day ceremonies and virtual SYF practices.

Due to Covid-19, these events had to be run synchronously online as the entire school community watched on. Nevertheless, our members rose to the challenge and proficiently coordinated between live and pre-produced videos for broadcast, allowing the virtual events to proceed without a hitch. Through these experiences, our students learnt how to respond to unforeseen challenges swiftly, work as a cohesive team and built on their capacities in event and stage management.

Our members also receive weekly training, so that they can better refine their technical skills and put them to good use in supporting future school events.
