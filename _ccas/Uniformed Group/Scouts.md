<p>This year marked a milestone as our unit proudly celebrated its 60th Anniversary,
commemorating six decades of camaraderie, resilience, and service. We also
attained the Frank Cooper Sands Award 2025, a testament to our excellence
in youth development, leadership, and community engagement. Several Scouts
earned the Chief Scout’s Award for their perseverance, initiative, and
exemplary character, while our leaders were honoured with the Chief Commissioner’s
Well-Done Badge for their outstanding dedication and impact. Through meaningful
activities, service projects, and outdoor adventures, our Scouts developed
vital life skills such as teamwork, communication, critical thinking, and
adaptability. Guided by the core values of integrity, respect, responsibility,
and compassion, we continue to nurture confident, capable individuals ready
to serve others and make a positive difference in the world.</p>
