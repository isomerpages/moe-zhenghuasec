#### Activities:

2019 has been an exciting year for Zhenghua NCC (Air) Unit.

Two of our Cadet Leaders, 3SG Tee Chin Shian and 3SG Ng Ray Zin, had the opportunity to go for Exercise Puncak in June where they trekked Mount Ophir, the sixth most difficult mountain in Malaysia. They forged new friendships with fellow cadet leaders from other Air units and enjoyed the memorable experiences during the trek.

Through the trainings and guidance from their seniors and teachers, our cadets performed well as two of them came in top 3 in their respective categories.
