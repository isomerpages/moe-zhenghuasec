Red Cross Youth Trailblazer Championships 2019 – Gold Award (Team members: Areefah Binte Abdul Karim; Lim Xin Yue, Ong Ying Mildred; Sun Qi Fei, Phaedra)

Zhenghua Red Cross Youth is pleased to attain the Gold Excellence Unit Award (EUA) for the year 2018. This award recognised the outstanding efforts of our cadets, volunteer instructors and youth officers. Our cadets’ passion and dedication spur them towards attaining accreditation badges in the various modules offered such as First Aid, Disaster Management and Youth Ambassadors’ Blood Programme.

Contrary to popular belief, Red Cross cadets does not just focus on first aid training; they are also given ample opportunities to hone their leadership skills, as well as forge friendship with their peers from other units through HQ-run activities like the Warrant Officers’ Programme.

It is with great hope that throughout their years in Zhenghua, all Red Cross Youth cadets will be able to cultivate the core Red Cross values of compassion, passion and professionalism for the service of mankind.
