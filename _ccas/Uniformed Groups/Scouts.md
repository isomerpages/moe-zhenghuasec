##### Activities - 2018:

Zhenghua Fox Scouts was invited by The Singapore Scouts Association to put up a pioneering project for the Adiji Chief Scout on Saturday 7 April 2018. It is the official event that is dedicated to welcome our Chief Scout, President Halimah Yacob. The scouts had the privilege to take a selfie with her!

This year, the scouts continue to participate in Job Week Camp to learn the dignity of labour and the value of hard work so they become better leaders and citizens of our World.  The Group Camp held in Sarimbun Scout Camp allows Scouts to appreciate nature and explore new skills such as cooking and advance knotting that is a requirement for attaining the Chief Commissioner’s’ Award.

With the National Patrol Camp looming near, our scouts are training hard for the Mother of all competitions in Scouting. All the Best, Zhenghua Fox!

##### Activities - 2017 and earlier:

Consisting of 8 scouts, the Zhenghua Fox Scout team has done the school proud by clinching the Gold Award in the recent National Patrol Camp (NPC) 2016 competition. Our scouts were also awarded the most prestigious Chief Commissioner's Challenge Shield for being the best Patrol. Our school is the sole achiever of this highest honour, past recipients of this honour included schools such as Catholic High, Victoria School and Holy Innocents'. Besides Catholic High, we are the only school to have attained the top position consecutively in 2013 and 2016.

As Scout HQ has put it, NPC is the "Mother of All Competitions" with 47 participating teams. The teams had to build their own campsite and complete a pioneering project, and go through a series of assessments on scouting skills and knowledge, such as First Aid, Scout Lore, Orienteering and Backwoodsman Cooking. Our team has outshone the other patrols, emerging top in Backwoodsman cooking, Camp Cook and Pioneering project.

It has been a meaningful and memorable journey for the Scout teachers, volunteers and boys. All the preparation and intensive training has paid off well. Living up to our motto for the competition: "Blood, Sweat, Tears, NPC", the boys persevered through the long and arduous process and now Zhenghua Fox Scout has carved a name for itself. Each time the shield is passed on, the successors are reminded of the outstanding performance by our boys.

Our unit's Chinese Drums team participated in numerous community performances that aimed to develop the aesthetics and confidence of our scouts. We had a great time preparing for the performances and it was a pleasure to see all the satisfied faces.
