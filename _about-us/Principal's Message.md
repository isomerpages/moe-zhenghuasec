<p>A warm welcome to Zhenghua Secondary School!</p>
<p>It is my honour to lead Zhenghua Secondary as its 5th&nbsp;Principal.
Having previously served as a School Leader in a Junior College and another
Secondary School, as well as a stint in MOE Headquarters, I believe that
I will be able to apply my experience to build on the strong foundation
of the school.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>We are living in an increasingly uncertain and fragmented world, and it
is critically important to prepare our students to be future-ready. Through
the collective input from teachers, students and our stakeholders, we have&nbsp;
articulated three desired outcomes for our students - Dynamic Learners,
Exemplary Leaders and Thoughtful Contributors. A dynamic learner is one
who learns because he wants to, not because he has to. An exemplary leader
does not only execute a task well but is also a good role model and inspires
others. Lastly, a thoughtful contributor does not just take and receive
but sees giving as a way of life.</p>
<p>To realise these student outcomes, together with my dedicated staff, supportive
parents and community partners, we will continue to plan and enact a forward-looking
curriculum, bolstered by a caring and inclusive environment. For instance,
as part of our Applied Learning Programme, students learn programming and
explore the role of technology in the world of transportation. Our Learning
For Life Programme in Outdoor Education also provides an excellent opportunity
for character and leadership development where our students build their
confidence using outdoor high elements located within our school campus.</p>
<p>With this, I shall sign off with lyrics from part of our school song which
encapsulate our aspirations for the students aptly:</p>
<p>Our dreams, our future
<br>We start to build them here.
<br>With courage we strive,
<br>Our hearts on fire.
<br>Our spirits undaunted,
<br>Our fears will disappear
<br>The way ahead is clear
<br>Letâ€™s look forward to a year of good health and joyful learning!</p>
