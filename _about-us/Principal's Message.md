### Principal's Message

<img src="/images/principalsmessage.jpg" style="width:183px;height:260px;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

A warm welcome to Zhenghua Secondary School!

It is my honour to lead Zhenghua Secondary as its 5th Principal. Having previously served as a School Leader in a Junior College and another Secondary School, as well as a stint in MOE Headquarters, I believe that I will be able to apply my experience to build on the strong foundation of the school.

Zhenghua’s vision of ‘Every Student, A Principled and Future-Ready Leader’ resonates strongly with me. The fact that our vision starts with ‘Every Student’ signifies the value and worth that we see in _each_ individual who joins the Zhenghua family. Here we strive to value-add to their holistic development, and for them to discover their purpose, passion and interests. This will put our students in good stead as they become future leaders of the society, being grounded in values and have the tenacity to deal with challenges, and seize opportunities.

To do so, together with my dedicated staff, supportive parents and community partners, we will continue to plan and enact a forward-looking curriculum, bolstered by a caring and inclusive environment. For instance, as part of our Applied Learning Programme, students learn programming and explore the role of technology in the world of transportation. Our Learning For Life Programme in Outdoor Education also provides an excellent opportunity for character and leadership development where our students build their confidence using outdoor high elements located within our school campus.

With this, I shall sign off with lyrics from part of our school song which encapsulate our aspirations for the students aptly:

Our dreams, our future <br>
We start to build them here. <br>
With courage we strive, <br>
Our hearts on fire. <br>
Our spirits undaunted, <br>
Our fears will disappear <br>
The way ahead is clear <br>
Let’s look forward to a year of good health and joyful learning!

Zhenghua Secondary School**
