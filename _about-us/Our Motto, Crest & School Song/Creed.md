<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/2025/Creed/2.png">
</div>
<p>Every ZSS staff is a role model</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>in conduct and attitude.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>going the extra mile to seek improvement to self, school and fraternity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in doing so, they inspire others around them to similarly strive for excellence.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Respect Others</h4>
<p>To respect others is to see the worth in every person I interact with
and to respect his/her dignity, feelings, opinions, and aspirations. If
I respect others then I must help them to be better persons and not be
an obstacle to their aspirations. I can only do this if I help to create
a school environment which will bring out the best in everyone.</p>
<h4>Respect Learning</h4>
<p>To respect learning is to recognize that learning is a lifelong process
which requires hard work and effort, but which is the only way to develop
my potential to the fullest. If I respect learning then I must start this
process in school and learn to lead a disciplined lifestyle to put in every
effort to ensure that I learn everything that is taught in school, to make
every activity a learning experience and to learn how to learn.</p>
<h4>Respect Environment</h4>
<p>To respect the environment means that I recognize that it belongs to everyone.
I must take care of it because it does not belong to me. My respect for
others demands that I must not deprive them of the environment through
my misuse.</p>
<h4>Respect Country</h4>
<p>To respect the country means that I will try to be a responsible citizen
and to follow all the laws of Singapore. I know that pupils who are Singapore
citizens must sing the National Anthem and take the Pledge. Pupils will
take the Pledge with the right fist placed over the heart. All foreign
pupils must show their respect by standing at attention for the duration
of the ceremony.</p>
