### School Song

#### Riding On The Winds Of Change

Our dreams, our future  
We start to build them here.  
With courage we strive,  
Our hearts on fire.  
Our spirits undaunted,  
Our fears will disappear  
The way ahead is clear

**Chorus**<br>
We are Zhenghua,  
Ambassadors of the school  
To Singapore and the world,  
Engaging and Creating,  
Riding on the winds of change,  
Towards our dreams we soar!.

Respect, Resilience, Responsibility  
Firmly we stand against adversity  
Integrity, Compassion  
To fuel our aspirations  
Our future is ours to hold

**Chorus**<br>
We are Zhenghua,  
Ambassadors of the school  
To Singapore and the world,  
Engaging and Creating,  
Riding on the winds of change,  
Towards our dreams we soar!.  
Towards our dreams we soar!
