### School Motto

<br> <br>

     style="width:55%">
		 
'Engage and Create' gives every student a lifelong guiding principle as an individual and as a team. The student will graduate with creativity, purpose, determination and engage the challenges life brings. In engaging the challenges, the students will create a better world for everyone.

In the school crest, the letter ‘Z’ in white represents water. It not only symbolises the continuous flow of knowledge and skills to be taught and learnt, but also the exuberance and vitality of youth. The learning will equip each student to face new challenges in his or her adulthood. The slashed Z represents the impact the Zhenghua student and graduate will make in the present and the future.

The blue globe, a stylised H, represents the global opportunities that are open to all who dare to accept the challenges beyond the confines of our country. We will go global while remaining rooted in Singapore.

The red represents the plasma of life. The slashed Z breaking out of its frame symbolises the need to break out of a mindset and its confines so that greater heights of achievement can be reached.
