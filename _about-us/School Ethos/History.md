### School History

Zhenghua Secondary School was established on 15 December 1999. Our school was initially housed in makeshift containers at Greenridge Secondary School. We only moved to our own premises at 91 Senja Road in December 2000.

Over the past 20 years, Zhenghua has grown from strength to strength, and has become a school well known in Bukit Panjang for our emphasis on character development and outdoor education.

Ms Cynthia Goh, our founding principal, established our school identity, and in particular the colour of our school uniform. This distinctive red and black continue to make our students stand out in the neighbourhood, and serve to remind our students that they are ambassadors of our school.  Our focus on sports and outdoor education was planted during her time through school wide activities like the mass exercise day. She also created the first version of our school song, and established the first set of school values – Commitment, Competence, Compassion. It was during Ms Goh's tenure that the school was officially opened on 1 Nov 2002 by former MP, Mr Gan Kim Yong who is currently the Minister for Health. Ms Cynthia Goh retired from the education service in December 2002.

Mr Lim Kuan Min, took over in December 2002 as our second principal and went on to be our school’s longest serving principal. He transformed the school under the mantra of No Discipline, No Learning. Character education was greatly emphasised through the CCAs, and our Uniformed Groups were established as our niche. Since then, at every National Day celebration, our Uniformed Groups proudly put up our very own National Day Parade march past in the parade square.  Mr Lim established outdoor education as a core part of the Zhenghua experience through the construction of the many outdoor elements that are still in use today to bring about character and leadership development. Mr Lim retired from the education service in December 2010.

Mrs Fiona Tan, our third principal from 2011 - 2014, strengthened our Character, Leadership and Citizenship programme, with the inclusion of our Moral Reasoning module. She expanded the Normal Curriculum experiential learning programmes, which led to us achieving the Lee Hsien Loong Innovations in Normal Curriculum award. The sabbatical programme at the end of Term 1 was also started under her time, which allowed students to develop themselves in various aesthetics and sporting pursuits. Building on our strength, Outdoor Education was then firmly established as our Learning for Life Programme. Mrs Tan was posted to HQ as a Cluster Superintendent in end 2014.

Mr Eugene Lin, our fourth principal from 2015 - 2021. Mr Eugene Lin has since been posted to Loyang View Secondary School in end 2021.

Mr Ng Hock Soon, our fifth and current principal took over the reins of the school from January 2022
