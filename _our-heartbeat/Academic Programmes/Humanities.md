<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Heritage Trail Experience</u>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students explored the Singapore River through route planning, risk assessments,
and presentations at historical sites. They researched and shared heritage
knowledge, sketched the Botero Bird, and created sculptures during the
art lessons later. The programme fostered critical thinking, creativity,
teamwork, communication, and cross-disciplinary learning, nurturing students’
appreciation of heritage while building confidence as dynamic, adaptable
learners.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Sustainability Trail Experience</u>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through the Sustainability Trail experience, students connected Geography
and Mathematics through real-world learning. They explored Singapore’s
water sustainability and applied mathematical concepts to analyse resources.
The programme-built knowledge of context sharpened analytical and cross-disciplinary
skills, and nurtured reflective learners ready to learn from mistakes,
fostering resilience and innovative thinking.</p>
