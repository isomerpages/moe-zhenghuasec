<h3>Programmes Highlights</h3>
<p><strong>Learning Is Fun &amp; Engaging@ZSSC&amp;T</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Craft &amp; Technology</strong>&nbsp;is a compulsory module for
the lower secondary students. It comprises of 3 subjects&nbsp;namely Design
&amp; Technology (D&amp;T), Nutrition and Food Science(NFS) and Art, which
offers opportunities for students to develop 21st Century Competencies
(21CC). Approaches are student-centred, using applied learning based on
the use of authentic real-life scenarios that are relevant in today’s context.
A range of both Formative and Summative assessments are used to help students
become self-directed learners as it creates awareness of their progress
and provides feedback on their level of mastery of content, knowledge and
skills. At lower secondary, students experience common curriculum in these
3 subjects.</p>
<p><strong>For Design &amp; Technology (D&amp;T) Common Curriculum (CC),</strong>&nbsp;Secondary
One, students get to experience the design thinking process for their acrylic
keytags and aluminium handphone holder.</p>
<p>In Secondary 2 Design and Technology (DT), students get to experience
creating prototypes as solutions to address the need for an organising
holder. Based on design process stages, students get to brainstorm solutions,
sketching ideas and planning their mock-ups to come up with interesting
organising holders</p>
<p>At the Upper Secondary, students will learn how to problem solve in real
life and experience the design thinking process through a mini coursework
in preparation for GCE coursework at Secondary Four. They will also learn
about the applications of technology in Structures, Electronics and Mechanisms.</p>

<p><strong>Food and Consumer Education(FCE)</strong>&nbsp;common curriculum
at Secondary One and Two, focuses on advocating nutrition and health, family
and the community. Students learn to appreciate how a variety of food is
used in food management and takes into consideration the issues of food
insecurity. Students apply scientific principles during food preparation
and cooking, and learn through activity/game-based learning on topics such
as food culture.</p>
<p>Nutrition and Food Science(NFS) at upper secondary delves deeper into

<p>Activity-based learning</p>
<p>In&nbsp;<strong>Art</strong>, students will be able to express their talents
by producing interesting art pieces and sculptures as well as harness the
use of ICT in their creations.&nbsp;The big idea is to develop critical
thinking and innovation in their design ideas, sound meal planning, and
creative art pieces. Sec 1 students designed, reinvented and created Superheroes
puppets that can exist in either the fantasy or real world.</p>
<p>Sec 2 students embarked on sculpture projects with wires or paper using
SCAMPER techniques in their designing. On STEM Day, some Sec 2B students
had fun with clay and made ocarinas after a hectic semester.</p>
<p>The secondary 3 art students did quick sketches to unleash their emotions
and imagination and used Sketchbook Pro as the medium to create digital
artworks. Senior Teacher, Mr Chia Wei Hou, from Raffles Institute, did
his work attachment in our school in Term 2.</p>
