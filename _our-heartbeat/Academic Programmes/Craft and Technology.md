<h3>Programmes Highlights</h3>
<p>The Craft &amp; Technology Department at Zhenghua Secondary School empowers
students with the creativity, skills, and resilience needed to thrive in
a rapidly changing world. Through <strong>Design &amp; Technology (D&amp;T)</strong>, <strong>Food &amp; Consumer Education (FCE)</strong>,
and <strong>Art</strong>, students explore different ways of designing,
creating, and problem-solving, while developing 21st Century Competencies
that prepare them for life beyond the classroom.</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Design &amp; Technology (D&amp;T):</strong> Students
develop creative thinking, problem-solving, and practical skills through
a structured design process. They begin with projects such as acrylic keytags
and LED night lights in Secondary One, progress to prototyping organisers
in Secondary Two, and advance to solving real-world problems at Upper Secondary
through coursework, exploring structures, electronics, and mechanisms.
<br>
</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Food &amp; Consumer Education (FCE):</strong> The
Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB) syllabus equips students with essential
life skills in nutrition, food safety, and resource management. Students
learn simple culinary skills, explore healthier living, and make informed,
sustainable decisions for themselves and their families. Inquiry-Based
Learning (IBL) further engages them through authentic tasks that encourage
curiosity, exploration, and collaboration.
<br>
</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Art:</strong> The Art curriculum
nurtures creativity, visual literacy, and critical thinking. Students express
their personal ideas through diverse art forms, including drawing, painting,
digital art, sculpture, and design. Learning is enriched through authentic
experiences such as sketching at the Singapore River, batik workshops,
immersion programmes, and post-secondary exposure at NAFA. Their works
are proudly displayed at the school’s in-house gallery, <em>ZSS Artbeat</em>,
and on national platforms like the PassionArts Festival.</p>
<p>Together, these three units form a dynamic department that nurtures confident
learners, creative thinkers, and adaptive problem-solvers who are ready
to contribute meaningfully to society.</p>
