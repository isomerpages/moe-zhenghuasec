### Programmes Highlights

**Learning Is Fun &amp; Engaging@ZSSC&amp;T**

**Craft &amp; Technology**&nbsp;is a compulsory module for the lower secondary students. It comprises of 3 subjects&nbsp;namely Design &amp; Technology (D&amp;T), Nutrition and Food Science(NFS) and Art, which offers opportunities for students to develop 21st Century Competencies (21CC). Approaches are student-centred, using applied learning based on the use of authentic real-life scenarios that are relevant in todayâ€™s context. A range of both Formative and Summative assessments are used to help students become self-directed learners as it creates awareness of their progress and provides feedback on their level of mastery of content, knowledge and skills. At lower secondary, students experience common curriculum in these 3 subjects.

**For Design &amp; Technology (D&amp;T) Common Curriculum (CC),**&nbsp;Secondary One, students get to experience the design thinking process for their acrylic keytags and aluminium handphone holder.

In Secondary 2 Design and Technology (DT), students get to experience creating prototypes as solutions to address the need for an organising holder. Based on design process stages, students get to brainstorm solutions, sketching ideas and planning their mock-ups to come up with interesting organising holders

At the Upper Secondary, students will learn how to problem solve in real life and experience the design thinking process through a mini coursework in preparation for GCE coursework at Secondary Four. They will also learn about the applications of technology in Structures, Electronics and Mechanisms.

**Food and Consumer Education(FCE)**&nbsp;common curriculum at Secondary One and Two, focuses on advocating nutrition and health, family and the community. Students learn to appreciate how a variety of food is used in food management and takes into consideration the issues of food insecurity. Students apply scientific principles during food preparation and cooking, and learn through activity/game-based learning on topics such as food culture.

Activity-based learning

In&nbsp;**Art**, students will be able to express their talents by producing interesting art pieces and sculptures as well as harness the use of ICT in their creations.&nbsp;The big idea is to develop critical thinking and innovation in their design ideas, sound meal planning, and creative art pieces. Sec 1 students designed, reinvented and created Superheroes puppets that can exist in either the fantasy or real world.

Sec 2 students embarked on sculpture projects with wires or paper using SCAMPER techniques in their designing. On STEM Day, some Sec 2B students had fun with clay and made ocarinas after a hectic semester.

The secondary 3 art students did quick sketches to unleash their emotions and imagination and used Sketchbook Pro as the medium to create digital artworks. Senior Teacher, Mr Chia Wei Hou, from Raffles Institute, did his work attachment in our school in Term 2.
