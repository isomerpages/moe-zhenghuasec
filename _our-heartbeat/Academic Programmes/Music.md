<p>The Music Programme at Zhenghua Secondary School provides students with
opportunities to explore rhythm, melody, harmony, and creativity through
performance and composition.</p>
<p>Grounded in our school vision of developing Dynamic Learners, Thoughtful
Contributors, and Exemplary Leaders, the programme helps students build
confidence, teamwork, and communication skills through music-making.</p>
<p>At the lower secondary level, Sec 1 students learn cajón and guitar, performing
as ensembles and sharing their music with peers through platforms such
as canteen screenings and break-time showcases. Sec 2 students advance
their skills on the ukulele, applying techniques such as tab reading and
plucking in band performances. They also engage in songwriting, combining
lyrics, chords, and melodies to create original works.</p>
<p>Through these experiences, students develop discipline, collaboration,
and creativity, while discovering the joy of expressing themselves through
music.</p>
