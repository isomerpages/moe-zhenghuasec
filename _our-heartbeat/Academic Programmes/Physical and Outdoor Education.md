<p>Physical Education (PE) is an integral part of our school curriculum,
designed to support the holistic development of every student. By emphasising
the importance of movement and one’s interaction with the environment,
PE nurtures students into physically competent and confident individuals
who value and enjoy a lifetime of active, safe, and healthy living.</p>
<p>At Zhenghua, our PE curriculum provides progressive and meaningful learning
experiences across the secondary school journey. By the end of Secondary
4/5, students are introduced to at least six different types of physical
activities and have opportunities to compete recreationally at the inter-class
Sports Fiesta and the biannual Road Race.</p>
<p>By the end of Secondary 3, students acquire key skills such as First Aid,
orienteering, and a strong sense of safety through team belay, rock climbing,
and scaling high elements. They also hone their organisational and outdoor
education skills by planning and carrying out their own class expedition.
These experiences culminate in a 4-Day 3-Night Outdoor Adventure Learning
Cohort Camp, a fully student-run highlight of our school’s Learning for
Life Programme (LLP).</p>
<p>Through such experiences, PE builds not only physical competence but also
values, resilience, and 21st Century Competencies that prepare students
to thrive in a fast-changing world.</p>
