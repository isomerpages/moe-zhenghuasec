<h3>ZHENGHUA SECONDARY SCHOOL<br>Direct School Admission</h3>
<p>In Zhenghua Secondary, we envision every student in the school to be Dynamic
Learners, Exemplary Leaders and Thoughtful Contributors. We create ample
opportunities for our students to develop their leadership competencies
and take on leadership roles through CCA and other school signature programmes.
Students who join us through DSA will have the opportunities to further
develop their talent areas under the guidance of our dedicated teachers,
experienced instructors, and enjoy the camaraderie of committed peers.
Prospective students can also look forward to representing the school in
competitions, performances and overseas trips.</p>
