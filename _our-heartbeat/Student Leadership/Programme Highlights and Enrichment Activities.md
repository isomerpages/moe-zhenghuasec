<p><strong>Student Leadership</strong> in Zhenghua Secondary is anchored in
the Leadership Challenge Model (LCM), which guides, nurtures, and moulds
students into future-ready leaders. The framework is built on five practices
of leadership: Model the Way, Enable Others to Act, Encourage the Heart,
Challenge the Process, and Inspire a Shared Vision.</p>
<p>Students are equipped with essential leadership skills to thrive in an
ever-changing world. It aims to develop responsibility, resilience, and
teamwork, enabling students to lead themselves and others effectively,
while preparing them to contribute meaningfully both in school and beyond.</p>
<p>Student Leadership provides progressive opportunities at different levels:
<br>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Self-Leadership: taking care of
and being responsible for oneself.
<br>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peer-Leadership: serving as class
leaders and CCA leaders.
<br>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thought-Leadership: taking on roles
in the Student Council and EXCO.</p>
<p>In addition, the Student Council conducts training in event planning and
mentoring, while leading key school-wide events such as Teachers’ Day and
the Secondary One Orientation Camp. Students are also engaged in Architects
of Zhenghua projects, Values-in-Action (VIA) projects, forums, and discussions,
which broaden their perspectives and connect them with the wider community.</p>
<p>Through this journey, students gain confidence, critical thinking, and
collaboration skills. They learn to lead with empathy and vision, carrying
their experiences beyond secondary school. Ultimately, the programme inspires
every Zhenghua student to “Be an Exemplary Leader — for others, for self,
for now, and for the future.”</p>
