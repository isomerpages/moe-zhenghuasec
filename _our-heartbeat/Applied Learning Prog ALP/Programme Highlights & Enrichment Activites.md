<p>The Future of Transportation Applied Learning Programme is designed to
develop students in the three Enhanced 21st Century Competencies: Adaptive
Thinking, Inventive Thinking, and Communication. Centred around the design
thinking framework, the programme challenges students to address real-world
transport issues with empathy and innovation.</p>
<p>Students begin their learning journey by exploring current challenges
in mobility and accessibility. Using AI tools, they generate and refine
problem statements based on the needs of various disabilities. They then
apply their understanding by designing inclusive transport solutions, building
functional cardboard prototypes embedded with Microbits to showcase key
features such as automation, safety, or user accessibility.</p>
<p>Through this iterative process, students learn to adapt to constraints,
think creatively under pressure, and communicate their ideas clearly to
diverse audiences. The programme not only builds technical skills and problem-solving
abilities but also cultivates empathy, resilience, and teamwork. Ultimately,
students emerge better prepared to contribute meaningfully to a world that
demands innovation and inclusivity in the way we move.</p>
<p>As part of the Mid-year Ziesta Programme, our Secondary 2 students embarked
on an exciting learning journey exploring The Future of Air and Sea Transport.
At the Changi Experience Studio, they discovered cutting-edge technologies
shaping the future of air travel. The journey continued at the Singapore
Maritime Museum, where they learned about the evolution of sea transport.
A thrilling boat ride around Singapore’s southern islands capped off the
experience, offering insights into our maritime heritage.</p>
