<p><strong>Outdoor Education for Character and Leadership Development</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Learning for Life Programme (LLP) centres on Outdoor Education for
Character and Leadership Development, providing students with transformative
experiences that build resilience, confidence, and environmental awareness
through hands-on outdoor adventures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong><em>Building Essential Skills</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Students develop fundamental outdoor competencies through our Physical
Education curriculum, mastering navigation, trip planning, outdoor cooking,
and shelter building. These practical skills form the foundation for progressive
outdoor challenges that foster independence and teamwork.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong><em>Progressive Learning Journey</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Our programme offers level-specific experiences that build upon each other.
Secondary 1 students embark on <strong><em>Inter-Disciplinary Trails</em></strong>,
utilising trip planning skills to explore Singapore's historically significant
blue and green spaces. Secondary 2 students tackle <strong><em>Orienteering at Zhenghua Nature Park</em></strong>,
applying navigation skills in unfamiliar terrain to locate checkpoints.</p>
<p>The pinnacle experience is our Secondary 3 Expedition Camp; a fully student-led <strong><em>4-Day 3-Night Outdoor Adventure Learning Cohort Camp</em></strong> where
students integrate all their learned competencies whilst taking complete
ownership of their outdoor experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong><em>Celebrating Excellence</em></strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;Every two years, our unique Outdoor Skills Challenge brings the
school community together in an exciting inter-class competition, where
students demonstrate their mastery of outdoor living, sense of place, and
risk assessment skills.</p>
<p>Through these varied experiences, students develop practical outdoor competencies
alongside essential character traits and leadership qualities that serve
them throughout their lives.</p>
