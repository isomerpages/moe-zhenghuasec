<h1>Character and Citizenship</h1>
<p>At Zhenghua Secondary School, the Character and Citizenship Education
(CCE) Programme anchors the holistic development of our students, guided
by our school values of Respect, Resilience, Responsibility, Integrity
and Compassion. Aligned with our school vision of developing Dynamic Learners,
Thoughtful Contributors and Exemplary Leaders, we provide platforms for
students to grow in character, values, and competencies.</p>
<p>Our CCE curriculum is delivered through CLC lessons, E-Portfolio reflections,
National Education Commemorative Days, VIA projects and ECG experiences.
Initiatives such as FamChamps also nurture family values and strengthen
relational skills.</p>
<p>Through these experiences, students develop the core 21st Century Competencies
of Adaptive Thinking, Inventive Thinking and Communication, equipping them
to contribute meaningfully to their families, school and nation.</p>
