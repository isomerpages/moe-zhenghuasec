<h1>Character and Citizenship</h1>
<p>Our school’s Character, Leadership, and Citizenship (CLC) Programme is
dedicated to nurturing students into Dynamic Learners, Exemplary Leaders,
and Thoughtful Contributors through a range of authentic and engaging learning
experiences.</p>
<p>Our Values-In-Action (VIA) programmes engage students in meaningful community
projects that positively impact the community. For instance, students have
coordinated initiatives such as the Share the Joy @ ZSS Chinese New Year
Community Project, where they visit low-income residents to identify their
needs, gather donations from teachers and students, and distribute food
items to those in need. Our FamChamps also share their family service projects
during morning assemblies, inspiring peers to build positive relationships
at home. The integration of e-portfolios supports students by allowing
them to reflect on their experiences, track their progress, and receive
constructive feedback, enhancing their preparation for future educational
and career opportunities.</p>
<p>Our National Education programme aims to deepen students’ understanding
of Singapore’s heritage and resilience. Students regularly participate
in experiential learning opportunities, such as Food Resilience Experiences
that emphasise sustainable food practices and their importance to national
security. They also engage in Learning Journeys to cultural institutions
like the National Museum, where they explore the nation’s history and cultural
heritage.</p>
<p>In line with our commitment to Education and Career Guidance (ECG), we
provide students with a diverse range of post-secondary options. The ECG
Symposium features alumni panel sharing sessions that offer insights into
the expectations of various institutions, helping students make informed
decisions about their educational and career paths. Additionally, our Work
Experience Programme collaborates with various organisations to provide
hands-on learning opportunities for students, allowing them to gain valuable
work experience and insights into various sectors.</p>
