### Cyber Wellness @ Zhenghua Secondary School

With the wide-spread use of mobile devices, social media platforms and the internet in this digital age, our students are constantly engaged in a myriad of online activities. As such, Zhenghua Secondary School is committed to educating our students on the importance of Cyber Wellness.

The school adopts MOE’s Cyber Wellness Framework to educate our students to be responsible users. Through this framework, students would have the opportunities to analyse and reflect on Cyber Wellness issues. Four key Cyber Wellness themes – cyber identity, cyber use, cyber relationships and cyber citizenship – will be covered in the curriculum to ensure our students are given a holistic coverage of Cyber Wellness issues.

In line with one of the Cyber Wellness principles of getting students to be positive role models and advocates for positive online behavior, the school leverages our Peer Support Leaders to take on the role of Cyber Wellness Ambassadors. During the Cyber Wellness Week, they conduct lessons with their class to raise awareness about cyber wellness issues and to also encourage their peers to be a positive influence on their peers.
