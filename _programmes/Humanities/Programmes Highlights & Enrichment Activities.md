### Programmes Highlight & Enrichment Activities

**1.Humanities Week** <br>
Engaging activities were conducted during the Humanities Week, titled "Unmasking New Territories". Students have a deeper appreciation of the Humanities and a better understanding of the world using game-based learning and current affairs articles.

**2. Virtual Geographical and Historical Investigation** <br>
For Geography, students viewed the park with the aid of technology such as google sites. Students then conducted their own field sketching to answer inquiry questions pertaining to water testing. For History, students were able to gain a better understanding of how the immigrants lived in colonial Singapore. They took the role of a tour guide and planned a virtual sightseeing tour in Singapore. Our teachers created YouTube videos to implement blended learning in History and Social Studies lessons for the upper secondary students.

**3. Learning Social Studies with a Geographical "lens"** <br>
Our Secondary One Normal Technical students has an opportunity to understand Social Studies through a Geographical lens, learning important skills like sketching, labelling and annotation as well as identification of trend.

During the Humanities week, students participated in the ‘ZSS Eraser Challenge’ where they had to answer questions about various countries, and then took turns to try to win one another’s erasers. It was an interesting activity for students to learn about the existence of other countries through the eraser game. The week also saw the Secondary 3 students battling it out in the annual inter-class humanities quiz. The quiz included questions on geography, history, and current affairs.

In addition, students were also given the opportunity to showcase their projects in the canteen. The week was indeed a great way to foster a love for the Humanities.

#### Istana Heritage Gallery Challenge

12 Secondary 2 students took part in the Istana Heritage Gallery Challenge, jointly organised by the Istana Heritage Gallery and Temasek Polytechnic. Upon reaching the Istana Heritage Gallery, the students were brought on a tour around the gallery where they learnt about the rich history of the Istana and also about the role of Singapore’s President. During the gallery tour, the students were able to draw links with what they have learnt in class about Singapore’s colonial past and were deeply engaged with the gallery guide. The students were then given a quiz where they had to go around the gallery to find the answers. The students enjoyed the Challenge and expressed interest in other such heritage events.

#### Sec 1 History Learning Journey to Singapore River
This year’s history learning journey was to the Singapore River. One of the most historic sites in Singapore that reflected and retained some of the key factors that led to our development as a modern metropolis. The Singapore River recognised the exact landing site of Sir Stamford Raffles, the man behind our first step towards development. Along the trail we got to understand that Singapore had a very early history of trading with our visit to the old empress place, where many artefacts were found in a recent archaeological dig. The trails also allowed us to get a feel of some old architecture that still remained such as the shop houses and Cavenagh Bridge. There were many sculptures along the river that replicated the type of people and occupations that used to exist in Singapore. Overall the Singapore river trail was a visual experience of the past and present, that allowed us to see how far Singapore has come from our humble beginnings.

#### Math-Humanities Trail @ Pang Sua Pond
The Secondary One Math-Humanities trail was held at the Marina Barrage previously. This year, with the adoption of Pang Sua Pond by our school, the trail incorporated various activities which brought the students from ZSS to Pang Sua. For Mathematics, real world problem-solving skills were the highlights. They included the concepts of diameter, volume and estimation to name a few. Water-testing of the pH and dissolved oxygen of the school pond were done at ZSS while sketching with their very own hand-made sketching frame was done at Pang Sua pond. Though it was a very hot morning, the students got to know the neighbourhood better and at the same time learning beyond the classroom was definitely evident.

#### Geography Learning Journey to MacRitchie Reservoir
The Secondary Two Normal Academic and Normal Technical students embarked on a 2-hour Active, Beautiful, Clean Waters (ABC Waters) Learning Journey to MacRitchie Reservoir as part of the post-mid-year-exam programme.

The students had the opportunity to explore MacRitchie Reservoir, being Singapore’s first reservoir and learnt more about Our Singapore Water Story in greater details. The students explored the biodiversity, human impacts on the natural environment and the ABC sustainable features. These activities aim to promote inquisitive and active learning in the students. It was a memorable and meaningful outdoor learning experience for the students. They were able to gain a deeper understanding of our waters and the diversity of life it supports.

#### Little India “See, Think and Wonder” Trail
The Little India “See, Think and Wonder” trail was a guided exploration for the Secondary Four Normal Academic students. Students walked down the streets lined with shops selling a variety of greens, fresh flowers, spices and many more that were unique to this ethnic enclave.  This trail helped to train our students in developing a pair of Geographical eyes to see how different groups of people used the different places and spaces in Little India.  At the same time, they would also learn how to infer the past by looking out for clues such as the Street names, urban land-use planning and how this common space exhibit a foster a strong sense of belonging with great interaction amongst the locals, tourists and shop owners. Ironically, this enclave was less visited by our local students.

Beyond the shops in Little India, do you know that the Little India Heritage Centre was situated in the heart of the enclave? Stepping into the heritage centre would bring the students into the colourful past of Little India which helped students to better appreciate how Little India transformed to what it is today. If you have not visited Little India, why not make a date with your friends and family to pop by this popular tourist attraction?

#### NUS Geography Challenge
The Humanities Talent Programme gives our higher ability students the opportunities to stretch their potential and to widen their horizon beyond what they learn in classrooms.  This year, our students participated in the annual NUS Geography Challenge The participants were Rayhan from 3E1, Claire from 3E3, Alicia Leong and Melvern from 3E4.

The Humanities Department took part in a few key activities this year in an attempt to provide our pupils with the opportunity to gain knowledge beyond the school curriculum.

#### Cultural trip to Chiangmai
The Humanities department together with the Craft and Technical department collaborated on a cultural and school exchange trip to Chiangmai, Thailand. The trip aimed to provide the 30-odd students the chance to experience authentic learning beyond the textbooks.

On the first day, students learnt about Thai cooking and even went on a marketing spree to shop for the ingredients. They showed much appreciation towards the hard work put into the food preparation. They also went to the ‘Elephant Poo Poo’ park, to observe how elephant droppings were made into papers and note books. On the next day, the students experienced other aspects of Thai culture by learning how to do simple silver crafts and umbrella painting. The students had great fun as some of them have not done such activities before. Lastly, the students went to JAKKAMKANATHORN Secondary School, where they were immersed in cooking, dancing, and singing planned by their Thai counterparts. The students shared how they found the trip enriching in widening their exposure and cultural awareness of others around them.

#### E3: Explore, Experience, Engage
The inquiry-based learning approach played an integral role in facilitating students’ learning. It excites pupils by making learning more fun and at the same time, create opportunities for independent learning.

For Geographical Inquiry, we carried out the pre-packaged walkabout around the neighbourhood in Bukit Panjang for the secondary 2 Geography students.

The Secondary 2 Historical Investigation focused on the impact the war had on Singapore. Students were asked to choose a war-time character and make war-time diary entries in that person's perspective. This project not only educated the students on the impact of the war on the country, but it also developed a sense of empathy for our past and a sense of gratitude for our present.
