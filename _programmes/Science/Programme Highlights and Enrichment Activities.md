### Programme Highlights and Enrichment Activities

It has been yet another fulfilling year for our science students, as the science department enriched the students’ learning experience with an array of learning opportunities, both in and out of the classroom.

##### Bacteria Transformation Workshop @ The Science Centre

4E3 Biology students entered the exciting world of genetic engineering by using sophisticated laboratory equipment and techniques to genetically transform bacteria to glow in florescence.

##### Making Learning Fun - Problem-based Learning and e-Pedagogy

Assuming the role of material engineers, Secondary 3 Physics students executed experiments to determine if unearthed sheath fragments originated from pure gold swords left behind by General Yamashita before he fled Singapore in 1945.

Meanwhile, Secondary 3 Chemistry students adopted various roles to manage a  mock chemical spill crisis. As scientists, environmentalists or doctors, they conducted experiments to determine the nature of the chemical spill and reported how they could deal with the spill in their respective capacities via video conference.

Science learning also became hands-on, as our lower secondary students constructed water purification devices using recycled materials.

With these authentic tasks, learning was made relevant and fun for our students!

##### STEM

During our annual STEM Day, secondary 2 students chose a workshop they are interested in and experienced what it is like to be working in the STEM industry. Some of the workshops available were Molecular Gastronomy, Urban Playspace, Microgreen, MAJ Aviation and Leo Studio.

##### Science Center STEP Sunburst Science Programme

A team of secondary one students participated in the year-long programme where they attended various workshops to deepen their science content knowledge and communication skills. During community outreach events, the students then had to convey science concepts to members of the public through explanation of exhibits, demonstrations and hands-on experiments! Chew Jie Ying (2E1): “I am more confident when speaking to a group of audience and I am happy to be able to share my passion for science with others!”

##### Lower Secondary Science

Lower Secondary students are involved in various projects including constructing a device to protect the eggs, poster designs, video production and learning journeys to SEA Aquarium, Botanic Gardens and the Singapore Zoo.

##### Chemistry

Secondary Three students participated in the ‘Amazing Chemistry’ workshop where students experienced many amazing chemistry tricks, and the ‘Crime Lab’ workshop where students analysed physical evidence from crime scenes.

To celebrate 2019 as the International Year of the Periodic Table of Chemical Elements, Science Centre Singapore has conducted the musical **“Curie Me Away”**, based on the life Marie Curie. Forty students got the precious opportunity to obtain seats for the ‘Curie Me Away’ musical which was spectacular and the students enjoyed themselves tremendously!

##### Biology

Students participated in various workshops such as bacterial transformation, blood typing and DNA extraction. This year, we also managed to secure an exclusive trip to St John’s Island for marine exploration. During the learning journey to Pulau Ubin, our students managed to see wild boars, fiddler crabs and a huge monitor lizard! In their groups, they produced a video on their chosen organism exclusive to Pulau Ubin.
