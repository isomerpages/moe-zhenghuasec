### Programme Highlights and Enrichment Activities

##### Math Competition

The Mathematics Competition is designed for Secondary 1 to 3 students. It was conducted as an intra-class competition in Term 3 using Kahoot!, Jeopardy and a PowerPoint game show.The competition evoked enthusiasm among students as they worked collaboratively and were forced to think out of the box!

##### Singapore Mathematics Olympiad

The Mathematical Olympiad is another programme which tests the ingenuity and problem-solving ability of the participants.

##### Mathematics Peer tutoring for lower secondary

Peer tutoring allowed students to serve as academic tutors to tutees. Through this program, tutors benefit by strengthening their mathematical concepts and learning the soft skills of compassion and patience.

##### International Mathematics Modeling Challenge

The International Mathematical Modeling Challenge allows students to work collaboratively in teams of 4 to solve a problem by developing and applying an original mathematical model. Through this challenge, students are able to apply Mathematical concepts they have learnt or researched to solve real world problems outside of classroom context.

##### 2T/3T Mathematics Trail

We went for the NT Mathematics trail to HortPark. We used an app and participated in a game like a scavenger hunt, where we needed to decipher the location of various stations based on the pictures in the app. It was interesting as we had never done anything similar before and we had to find the places to solve difficult, real-life mathematics questions. It was fun working with friends as we could communicate easily. The trail was also helpful to help us apply mathematics concepts in our daily lives, and helped people who struggled with mathematics to appreciate the subject a bit more.

##### Sec 1 Mathematics and Humanities Trail

The Sec 1 iPad trail was about solving mathematics questions at various stations within the allocated time. To find the questions, we needed to find the QR codes scattered around the school and Pang Sua pond. Throughout the trail, my team worked together and we learnt that Mathematics is important and also applicable to our everyday life. I really think that this trail is beneficial to the students and hope that the school can continue with it in the future.

##### Project Ace

The competition was an interesting expereince. We were tasked to solve the mathematical problems online in a game format. It was challenging because we needed to be both fast and accurate. I enjoyed the game because it was exciting and I got to level up when I finish all the questions. I also had to make use of what I learned in Sec 1 and the process made me become more aware of the topics that I am weak in. I am happy and proud to have come in third in the competitors among all the schools in the cluster.

##### Mathematics Learning Symposium

When I was told that my group mates and I had to present at the Cluster West 6 Mathematics Learning Symposium, I thought that it would be a piece of cake as I assumed that I only had to plan out an itinerary for an Australian family and calculate the total cost. However I later realised that it was more complicated than expected, as we had to use Mathematical Modeling to formulate the problem into a real world problem. In the process, we had to understand the problem, make assumptions, solve the problem mathematically, and think of how factors in the real life can affect our problem and to reflect on our solution.

Subsequently, my team and I went to Assumption English School to present our project to the other schools in our cluster. As we presented our project to other schools, we received some feedback from them. There were also other schools there to present their mathematical model for a different real world problem and we learnt a lot from their presentations as well. Overall, we really benefited from this project as this was something that we did not usually do in class. This project really helped me understand the importance of mathematics and learn to apply mathematical concepts when solving real world problems.

##### Mathematics Inter-Class Competition

The Mathematics Inter-class Competition was an annual event for Secondary 1 to Secondary 3 students to compete in a series of fun and challenging questions which are out of syllabus. The first segment of the competition comprised of multiple-choice questions, thus my team members and I split the work to find the best and most fitting answers. For the second part of the competition, we worked on different solutions and then discussed them to spot any mistakes. I thought that this was a great activity as we got a bit of out-of-class fun but at the same time benefited from the rich learning. The questions were challenging but fun to solve, and I would love to take part in such activities again.

##### STEM

I went for a game-design workshop as part of the STEM post-exam activity.  The workshop was about creating a game using a coding software called Scratch 2.0 that allowed beginners to understand and apply basic coding.  Each of us created our own game but was grouped in pairs to help each other if needed. I feel that the school should organise more of these programmes as they provide students with a different kind of learning experience and environment.

##### Banglore Trip

Prior to the trip, we had concerns if we would be able to get along with the locals due to language and cultural barriers.  However, we realised that the locals were very warm, hospitable and creative.  We made many good friends at the local public school which we visited.   We were impressed that computer coding was included in their curriculum and there was so much we could learn from them.  Despite their limited resources, the children enjoy learning and it made us appreciate how privileged we are in Singapore.
