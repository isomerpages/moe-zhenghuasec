### Programmes Highlights & Enrichment Activities

The school’s CLC Programme aims to develop principled and future-ready leaders by engaging students in a wide range of learning experiences that are authentic and relevant to students’ lived realities.

With the changing socio-political climate, we endeavor to nurture citizens with a sense of belonging, reality, and hope. By discussing contemporary issues with classmates, students engage with events happening in society and develop multiple perspectives.

For example, students explored our local food heritage and the challenge of sustaining hawker culture as we celebrated its inscription onto the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural of Humanity, building a sense of pride in our culture.

We continue to adapt and seize new opportunities afforded by technology amidst the challenge of the pandemic. Programmes like the Secondary 1 Family Matters VIA project have gone online, leveraging blended learning days.

Aware of the impact the pandemic has had on our community, the school continued with key programmes such as the CNY community outreach to the rental blocks. These learning experiences develop our students to be active citizens with the will to act.

#### Social and Emotional Learning

Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) contributes to students’ well-being. SEL enables our students to live out the values that guide their lives. Through SEL, students develop the skills to manage themselves, build healthy relationships and make responsible decisions.

*   Self-awareness: Know your strengths and limitations, with a well-grounded sense of confidence, optimism, and a “growth mindset”.
*   Self-management: Effectively manage stress, control impulses, and motivate yourself to set and achieve goals.
*   Social awareness: Understand the perspectives of others and empathise with them, including those from diverse backgrounds and cultures.
*   Relationship management: Communicate clearly, listen well, cooperate with others, resist inappropriate social pressure, negotiate conflict constructively, and seek and offer help when needed.
*   Responsible decision-making: Make constructive choices about personal behaviour and social interactions based on ethical standards, safety, and social norms.

#### Student Recognition

A holistic education system places exemplary character on par with academic excellence. MOE and the school recognises the importance of acknowledging students who have demonstrated good character, values and leadership. These awards serve as a celebration and recognition of the achievement of our students.

*   Edusave Character Award
	*   The Edusave Character Award (ECHA) is given by MOE and recognises students who demonstrate exemplary character and outstanding personal qualities through their behaviour and actions.
* Principled Leader Award
	* The Principled Leader Award recognises students from each cohort who demonstrate exemplary leadership qualities.
* School Values Award

#### Values in Action

Values in Action (VIA) are learning experiences that support students' development as socially responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully to the community, through the learning and application of values, knowledge and skills. VIA fosters student ownership over how they contribute to the community. As part of the VIA programme, students reflect on their experience, the values they have put into practice, and how they can continue to contribute meaningfully.

Our aim is to ensure that by the end of a students’ time with the school, they would have experienced the various aspects of community service and developed a sense of compassion for the less fortunate, echoing one of our school values of serving with compassion.

Our VIA programme is designed to expose students to a variety of community needs.

*   Secondary 1 – Environmental advocacy in partnership with kindergartens in the community
*   Secondary 2 – Building an inclusive society for people with disabilities
*   Secondary 3 – Appreciating and caring for our seniors
*   Secondary 4 – Community Champions Project
*   Secondary 5 – Serving residents in the Bukit Panjang Community (CNY outreach to rental blocks)

Beyond the cohort VIA programmes, CCAs also have customised VIA experiences for students. For example, students from the Performing Arts CCAs regularly visit seniors at Bo Tien Day Activity Centre for the Elderly.

#### National Education

National Education (NE) is important for nurturing a future generation of citizens who love Singapore and have a strong sense of belonging to Singapore. The National Education programme aims to develop national cohesion, cultivate the instinct for survival as a nation and to instil in our students the confidence in our nation's future and develop a strong sense of belonging to Singapore. In Zhenghua Secondary School, we hope to nurture students who are inclusive individuals, concerned about global issues and be able to lead, contribute and serve in the global arena, with emotional rootedness to Singapore.

NE is anchored on the following citizenship dispositions, which will enable our youth to realise their part in the flourishing of their community and nation:

*   A sense of belonging: To develop a deeper understanding of who we are, and a shared understanding of the values that are important to us as a nation.
*   A sense of reality: To be aware of the contemporary realities - including Singapore’s constraints and vulnerabilities - which affect us as a nation amidst the backdrop of a less predictable world.
*   A sense of hope: Having confidence and optimism in Singapore’s future and the resilience to face the challenges ahead.
*   The will to act: Ultimately, these citizenship dispositions cultivate the will to act; to be active citizens who have a collective resolve and a sense of shared mission toward building a Singapore for all.

We also celebrate the 4 NE Commemorative Days:

*   Total Defence Day

Schools commemorate Total Defence Day (TDD) on 15 February annually to mark Singapore's fall to the Japanese in 1942. Total Defence Day serves to remind our students that Singapore is defensible and is worth defending, and we ourselves must defend Singapore.

*   International Friendship Day

International Friendship Day (IFD) allows students to understand the importance of good relations with our neighbours and beyond. Students learn how Singapore pursues an active engagement in the world through international organisations such as ASEAN and the United Nations. Building mutual respect and understanding across cultures enables us to learn from the different backgrounds and experiences of people who come to Singapore to live, work and study.

*   Racial Harmony Day

On 21 July each year, schools commemorate Racial Harmony Day (RHD) to mark the anniversary of the 1964 racial riots. On this day, students will reflect on and celebrate Singapore as a harmonious society built on a rich diversity of cultures. RHD serves as a reminder that promoting social cohesion and racial harmony requires collaborative efforts from our educators, students and stakeholders.

*   National Day

National Day marks our separation from Malaysia, and our emergence as an independent country in the community of nations.

NE is also infused in our daily routines such as flag raising ceremony and reciting the pledge, in academic subjects, and co-curricular experiences such as CCAs and Learning Journeys.

#### Education and Career Guidance

Education and Career Guidance (ECG) is about equipping students with the necessary knowledge, skills and values to make informed decisions at each key education stage for successful transition from school to further education or work, and hence to manage their career pathways and lifelong learning throughout their lives. Through ECG, social emotional competencies and qualities of proactivity, adaptability and resilience are developed to prepare students for the 21st Century.

In Zhenghua Secondary, a comprehensive Education and Career Guidance Programme comprising work attachment and seminars are in place for students to learn valuable life skills and prepare for the world beyond school.

The goals of ECG are to:

*   nurture student’s self-awareness, self-directedness and life skills for continuous learning and training; (Skills)
*   enable students to explore viable education and career options through the provision of accurate and comprehensive information; (Knowledge)
*   inculcate an appreciation for the value of all occupations and how they contribute to the well-functioning of society; (Mindsets) and
*   equip students with skills and means to positively engage their parents and other career influencers (Engaging the community).
