### Vision

Every student, a Principled and Future-Ready Leader.

### Mission

To prepare every student to better meet the challenges of the future by building the student's emotional, ethical, intellectual, physical and social capacity.

### Goals

*   Students who are grounded in values, and who uphold high moral and ethical standards.
*   Students who are adaptable and able to embrace challenges with a positive and resilient mind-set.
*   Students who lead life with a deep sense of purpose and meaning.
*   Students who are able to lead self and others well into the future.
*   Students who contribute to the greater good of the community, society and Singapore.

The school’s CCE programme aims to develop principled and future-ready leaders by engaging students in a wide range of learning experiences that are authentic and relevant to students’ lived realities. Our students learn to build strong and healthy relationships, thrive in a world of social media, serve the needs of their community, embody values and learn resilience, and understand their roles in Singapore and the world as active and engaged citizens. In light of the rapidly changing global socio-political climate, we endeavor to nurture citizens with a sense of belonging, a sense of reality, a sense of hope, and the will to act.

The goals of the CCE programme are achieved through the various programmes where teachers are integral in facilitating students’ learning. These programmes include:

*   Character, Leadership, Citizenship (CLC) Lessons
*   Sexuality Education
*   Values in Action
*   Cyber Wellness
*   Education and Career Guidance
