### Programme Highlights & Enrichment Activities

#### ICT Direction
The department seeks to provide a pervasive ICT-enriched learning environment to engage students in meaningful AAL (Anywhere, Anytime Learning) experiences. This goes in line with MOE Master Plan goals of inculcating our pupils to be self-directed and collaborative learners equip with 21CC skills.

The school leverage the use of suitable ICT tools such as GOOGLE Classroom, NEARPOD, QUIZLET, KAHOOT and Student Learning Space to engage students as active learners and co-creators of knowledge.

The department review teachers’ competencies to develop ICT enriched lesson and develop ICT champions to provide mentorship to department's teachers so as to professionally develop them to be proficient in adopting e-pedagogy in lesson designs.

#### Programme Highlights
**IMDA Lab on Wheels programme** <br>
The school embarked on a collaboration programme with IMDA to enhance students’ digital readiness and ignite their passion for technology via engaging and experiential platform’s activities.

Platforms were set up in the school to showcase new and cool technology, to raise students’ awareness of the threats in the cyber world, as well as to develop their understanding of the importance of cybersecurity and Artificial intelligence concepts.

Students were also given the opportunity to work with Channel News Asia (CNA) to film one of the sessions on the Cyber Security themed bus for a new infotainment TV series named “**Cyberpunkd**” hosted by local stand-up comic Fakkah Fuzz. The show focused on cyber vulnerabilities and aimed to encourage cyber vigilance in the everyday Singaporean, and attempted to sell cybersecurity as not just about protecting ourselves, but also the people in our network

**ITPW Programme** <br>
ITPW programme was incorporated into secondary one curriculum to develop students with the necessary ICT media literacy skills for future needs. The programme adopts a problem-based approach to get the students to research a given problem scenario and to create a digital artefact to present their findings.

The school actively seek to create an interactive ICT mobile learning environment where educational apps were frequently used to promote greater student-centric lesson, allowing students to learn across multiple contexts through content and social interaction.

**Microbits Programme** <br>
To expose students to the fundamentals of programming, all secondary 2 students get to experience being a programmer through Applied Learning Programme (ALP) and MICROBITS programming lessons. In the micro-bit lessons, students get to learn how to program the MICROBITS to collect analytical data for eg, data on soil humidity and temperatures for science projects and data on weather conditions for Geography projects. Student Learning Space (SLS) was used as a platform to deliver these lessons where students learned coding in pairs.

**Drones Programme** <br>
As part of the effort to further expose students to coding, secondary three students were given opportunities to try out programming for drone-flying during the school post-exam enrichment activities. Students in the team of four collectively designed codes to fly the drones to complete some of the tasks missions assigned.
