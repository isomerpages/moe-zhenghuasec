### Vision

Self-Disciplined and Responsible Students of Integrity

### Philosophy

With Discipline Comes Learning

### Belief

Discipline takes time, takes patience, takes understanding, and requires a holistic approach. Discipline is not about instilling fear or imposing blind obedience. Discipline is inculcating students with a sense of responsibility and integrity, and guiding them to do the right thing.
