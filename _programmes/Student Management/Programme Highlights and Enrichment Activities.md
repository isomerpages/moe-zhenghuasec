### Programme Highlights and Enrichment Activities

#### DISCIPLINARY APPROACH

##### Culture of Care
We establish a positive and caring school and classroom environment in which. Students feel physically and psychologically safe, teachers and students demonstrate respect for one another, students are engaged in meaningful learning with minimal disruptions and students feel connected to the school through strong and healthy teacher-student and student-student relationships.

##### Centred on School Values
Students are to be grounded in socially acceptable norms and values, and are taught to live out the school values of respect, responsibility, resilience, integrity and compassion. School programmes and curriculum aim to nurture in our students the social and emotional competencies to deal with emotions, control their impulses, respect others, take perspectives, manage conflict and work with others.

##### Whole-School Approach
All teachers play a crucial role in ensuring a strong discipline in Zhenghua by sharing a common language and establishing similar practices and processes, working together towards a common goal.  Teachers are role models and should display the right values through word and deed in all interactions with students and fellow colleagues.

##### Intervention Measures
The school provides support for specific groups of students who require help in managing their behaviours. In addition to the regular teaching and demonstrating of school values and social norms, the school also implements an early identification and prevention programme for students at-risk.
