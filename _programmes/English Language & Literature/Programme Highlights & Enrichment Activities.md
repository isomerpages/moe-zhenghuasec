### Programme Highlights & Enrichment Activities

The belief that every student is able to grow in their repertoire and knowledge of the English language as they journey with us at Zhenghua Secondary School is a belief that the English and Literature department holds close to our hearts. It forms the crux of how we teach, prepare, develop and nurture our learners into confident, reflective, critical thinkers and communicators of the 21st century.

Through our signature programmes, the English and Literature department aims to unlock our students’ hidden potential and encourage the rich exploration of language in innovative ways beyond the classroom. Every year, students participate in the annual EL and Humanities Week, where they try their hand at blackout poetry, English puzzles and more, to explore the language in fun and immersive ways. Our debate, drama and creative writing workshops help to foster rich learning in students as they delve into different facets of language learning, while also cultivating their various talents and interests. To further stretch them beyond their comfort zones, the department also supports students as they participate in competitions such as the Orator’s Trophy, National Schools Literature Festival and Write for Kindness competition. All these and more await you in our English and Literature classrooms!

<br> <br> <br> <br> <br>

In a bid to immerse students in an English and Literature-rich environment, students at Zhenghua enjoy a meaningful week of fun and enriching activities in and out of the classroom. They enjoyed flash fiction writing, blackout poetry, movie screenings, talks by local writers and poets and participate in school-wide competitions such as the Plain English Speaking Awards (PESA) and the ACJC Orator’s Trophy. To further increase their awareness and competence in the language, students participate actively in external events and competitions that are held every year. These include the Inter-School Philosophy Dialogue, the All In! Young Writers Festival, and the Unity Young Writers’ Festival. Through the various signature programmes, students are provided the necessary scaffold and structures to grow and learn in a spiral progression fashion.

#### An Eventful English and Literature Week
Words: Amber Yeap (2E1) & Lim Shu Qi (2E1)

During the English and Literature week conducted in Term 1, students from each level participated enthusiastically in an array of activities that included a movie screening, talks by local writers and various level-wide English competitions.

<br> <br> <br> <br>

The Secondary 1 students took part in blackout poetry where they took newspaper cuttings and turned them into wonderful poems! <br>
The Secondary 2 students on the other hand, had reading sessions in their every English class where they were required to read a few pages of a book after which they were to write reviews on the books. Some great book reviews from the Secondary 2 students were picked out and the students were presented prizes during the morning assembly. <br>
The secondary 3 students went to the school library to borrow books brought in from the National Library Board (NLB). They wrote book reviews or had book trailers which were displayed at the back of their classrooms and showcased on the TV screens in the canteen.

The week saw plenty of sharing of stories and poems both by teachers and students. Some even got to read their original poems to the entire school!

One such aspiring poet is Aurelia from 3E4. Her poem was written for the Unity Young Writers Festival and to the theme ' Towards a Common Future '.  She shared:

_“I decided to focus on three main aspects: global warming, equality and security. With each one, I created a stanza with what could happen if we got that aspect right, especially if we take things to the extreme.”_

Another presenter at the morning assembly was Li Hui, a Secondary 4 pure literature student who shared her experience on attending a literature workshop with 5 other schoolmates. She shared what she learned that day with the rest of the school. We have to admire her perseverance in writing a script and rehearsing it several times with the teachers given that it was her first experience at public speaking in front of a large audience. Well done, Li hui!

Much like Li Hui and Aurelia, many students learned a lot through the week. Remember not to address your teachers as ‘Chers’!

Our English Language programme exposes students to the use of English in various contexts. This year, our school has had a strong emphasis on cultivating reading as a habit and encouraging confident speakers. From speech writing to drama, students are prepared to be ready for their future beyond the national examinations.

Secondary 1 students took part in a public speaking workshop where they learnt basic presentation techniques. At secondary 2, their performance skills were honed through a drama workshop which many enjoyed. Secondary 3 students were taught the ropes of debating to develop their argumentative skills. This ended with a much anticipated Inter-class debate championship where classes faced off with one another.

Aside from our signature programmes, English Week traditionally kicks of the year with various competitions and activities. This year, students took part in the Plain English Speaking Award (PESA), a Caption Competition, Blackout Poetry and other activities that sparked the joy of learning English.
