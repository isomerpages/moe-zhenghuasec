### Programme Highlights & Enrichment Activities

Our Applied Learning Programme is undergoing a revamp this year to expand its focus beyond mbot and robotics but a broader theme on Future of Transportation. The new programme remains two-tiered. Tier 1 programme includes mbot for Secondary 1, Maqueen and Drone for Secondary 2 while Tier 2 programme is interest-based covering STEM Day and STEM related enrichment activities.

Riding on the heels of increasing popularity for product delivery, the Secondary 2 programme will allow students to experience planning for logistics supply in a metropolitan and using Maqueen robots and flying drones to carry out the delivery tasks through team activities.

Our tier 1 Applied Learning Programme involves coding using Scratch Programming for secondary 1 students and a mbot (a robot kit) for secondary 2 students. While the programme is standardised across the level, classes of higher readiness could move beyond the standard lessons for a more enriching learning experience. For example, 2E4 had a chance to design Sumo bots to complete a mission whereby all other robots were pushed out of the play field.

As a reward for being the winners of Google Hackathon Workshop conducted in 2016, our students were invited to visit Google Data Centre on 25 July 2018. The visit certainly left an indelible impression on our students.

Our STEM Day was conducted during the mid-year post-examination period. More than 70% of the students surveyed enjoyed the STEM workshops conducted.
