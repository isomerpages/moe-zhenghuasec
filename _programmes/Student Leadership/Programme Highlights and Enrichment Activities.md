##### Student Leaders' Investiture

The student leadersâ€™ investiture was organized by a group of student councilors from Secondary two to Secondary four. Every Secondary three leader from their respective CCA took over the leadership role from their senior in this symbolic ceremony. The leaders want to continue the legacy of their seniors in helming the CCA together with their teachers.

The investiture provide a platform to recognize the efforts for our graduating leaders and in-coming leaders. The exchange of a symbolic item will remind them the roles and responsibilities of a leader in their CCA. The lower secondary students will look up to them as role models as seniors in the school.
