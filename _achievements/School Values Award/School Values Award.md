Values education plays an important role in shaping oneâ€™s character. The School Values Award (SVA) recognises students who are exemplary in character and a positive influence on their peers. Awardees are nominated by peers and teachers, and have consistently displayed good character through the exhibition of our school values of Respect, Resilience, Responsibility, Integrity, and Compassion.
