|National Day Celebration and Sports Fiesta 2023|
|--|
|To make National Day 2023 more meaningful and engaging, we collaborated with the PE Department to have Sports FIESTA. The Sports Fiesta was also an avenue to strengthen students’ appreciation for Total Defence – in particular, Social Defence and Psychological Defence. During Sports Fiesta, students from each level competed in different sports as a culmination of 16 hours of training during their PE lessons. ![](/images/nationalday1.png)|
|It was very fun, and it was a nice experience. It was also very interesting to see how people play netball and work closely as a class.<br><br>Kaelyn Low Jie Ying (1B)|
|Volleyball with my classmates was an exhilarating experience. The atmosphere was charged with energy and friendly competition as we showcased our skills on the court. It was amazing to see teamwork and strength among the other classes. I enjoyed it very much.<br><br>Chan Weng Xuen (2D) |
|I had an absolute blast participating in the Sports Fiesta. It exposed me to a new sport. The teamwork among the class, the rush of chasing the ball, and the excitement of scoring a goal made it an unforgettable experience.<br><br>Pek Keng Oon (3F)|
