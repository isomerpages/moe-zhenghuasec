|As part of our endeavor to develop our students holistically and provide bountiful opportunities for them to lead and develop resilience, our secondary 3 students went on a 3-day 2-night outdoor camp after months of preparation.|
|The highest moment of the camp was when my class reached the top of the Pasir Panjang Park. The view was really great; the class was tired but enthusiastic at the same time. It really warmed my heart to see every student in my class so relieved and refreshed despite the challenging hike up. It was also nice to see how we encouraged one another during the hike up. <br><br>Sherlyn Yeo Cai Yun (3B)|
|The student leadership component in the camp helps people to be leaders and to learn more about &nbsp;how to be a leader. I learnt that even if in hardships, we can grow to become better persons and work as a team. <br><br>Richika Patnana (3G)|
|Ms Choo and Mrs Koh, thank you for helping us with the planning of the camp. It was the first time most of us are planning for one so it can be confusing. Thank you for also supporting us during the hike as it was very tiring and guiding us when we went the wrong way. <br><br>Boey Yu Feng Adrain (3F)|
|It was challenging trying to manage the entire class and to deliver a message to all of them.&nbsp; I learnt that it is important to be resilient to get a job done and that teachers often make sacrifices for us. <br><br>Iden Ang (3G)|
