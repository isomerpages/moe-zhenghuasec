<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Personalised Digital
Learning Programme (PDLP) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>1. What is PDLP about?</strong>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>MOE announced in March 2020 that we will strengthen students’ digital
literacy through the launch of a National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP)
for our schools. This better enables our students, at different stages
of their education journey, to acquire the digital skills required to navigate
the digital age. As part of the NDLP, all Secondary School students will
be equipped with a Personal Learning Device (PLD). &nbsp;By equipping students
with their own PLD, we can:
<br>
<br>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Enhance Teaching and Learning</strong>: PLDs harness technology
for greater effectiveness in teaching and learning, enabled by teachers’
use of e-Pedagogy to provide active learning experiences for students.
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Support Self-Directed and Collaborative Learning</strong>: PLDs
enable students to learn online according to their needs and interests,
and to collaborate with each other, anytime and anywhere.
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Support the Development of Digital Literacies</strong>: PLDs provide
an immersive environment for students to develop the dispositions, knowledge
and skills to thrive in the digital environment.
<br>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. How will this be implemented in Zhenghua Secondary School?</strong>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>In line with our school vision of preparing every student to be principled
and future-ready leaders, all Sec 1 – 5s will be equipped with a PLD in
2025. Our school has chosen Chromebooks as our preferred PLD.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>3. Why Chromebooks?</strong>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>In Zhenghua Secondary School, we have been tapping on ICT platforms supported
by Chrome OS to prepare our students to be dynamic learners. In addition,
Chromebooks as compared to laptops tend to be lighter, and with batteries
that can last longer. They are also more affordable than tablets as the
Chromebooks we have chosen include the keyboard, stylus, mouse, touchscreen
and dual cameras, unlike tablets which can become quite costly once we
include the additional accessories.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>4. How much does my child have to pay for the device?</strong>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>MOE will use bulk tenders to keep the PLDs affordable. The Chromebooks
with the enhanced 3 year warranty will cost less than $580. For students
on financial assistance, we will provide further subsidies so that their
out-of-pocket expenses is zero. This is to ensure that no student is denied
the opportunity to benefit from the programme.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Specific costs and details will be communicated to all parents in January
2025.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>5. Can my child not purchase the device?</strong>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Every student is required to have a device for teaching and learning purposes
and is encouraged to purchase one through our school via MOE’s bulk tender.
Students are encouraged to use the device model prescribed by the school,
as the uniformity of systems and software would ensure a smooth learning
experience for everyone. The device purchased through the school will come
with the necessary warranty and insurance as well.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Students who do not wish to purchase a device because they already have
their own devices will have to check with the school to ascertain whether
the specifications of their existing devices meet our school’s requirements.
These existing devices must also be installed with a Device Management
Application (DMA) software to manage the student’s access and usage.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>6. How will the device be used by my child?</strong>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>The devices will be used to complement classroom teaching by promoting
active learning and greater personalisation of our students’ schooling
experience. Students can make use of digital tools such as calendaring
and note-taking applications to enhance their personal productivity. They
will also have more opportunities to connect, discuss and collaborate with
their peers through online digital platforms. The device will also be used
beyond the classroom for home-based and self-directed learning, so that
students can benefit from a seamless learning experience in school and
outside of school.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>7. How will the school help my child to manage the use of the device?</strong>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>All PLDs will have a Device Management Application (DMA) installed. The
DMA is a suite of software installed in the device to enable the school
and parents to manage and monitor device usage by students. The DMA would
restrict the type of applications and websites accessible by students and
limit the students’ screen time. For example, inappropriate websites with
adult or extremist content, as well as gaming and gambling websites or
applications, will all be restricted. We will also disable the device from
a certain time at night so that students do not spend excessive amounts
of time on their devices at home.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>The DMA would allow the school to remotely download appropriate teaching
and learning applications, as well as security patches, into every student’s
device. In addition, the DMA comes with classroom management capabilities
to assist teachers in actively monitoring and controlling the students’
screens during lesson time, for better student management and effective
teaching.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Parents will be informed of the activation of Parent's DMA portal and
choice of DMA options which will give parents different levels of control
over their child's device after school hours (6 pm to 7 am the following
day)
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>In addition, through CCE lessons, students will be taught how to embrace
the convenience of technology while maintaining a balanced lifestyle between
online and offline activities, and to be a safe and responsible user of
technology.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>8. How will the school help my child to manage possible cyber risks and cyber addiction?</strong>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>As part of our school’s Cyber Wellness education, students learn how to
take responsibility for their online well-being, and how to be positive
role models to others in creating safe and kind online communities. The
revised CCE 2021 will also feature cyber wellness education more strongly,
with updated authentic scenarios used, to better equip students to navigate
online spaces safely and help develop a more supportive cyber environment.</p>

<br>
</p>
<p>All parents are automatically members of the Zhenghua Secondary School
Parent Support Group (ZSS PSG). The ZSS PSG is a network of parents working
in close partnership with the school. Being part of the PSG is a great
opportunity to be closer to our children, understand them better, and support
them in their educational journey. Members can participate in school activities
and events, contribute to initiatives, network with other parents, and
learn more about helping our children thrive in society.</p>
<p></p>

will also gain support from other parents in your parenting journey.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>2) Transition to Secondary School Life Parenting Workshop and PSG Welcome [8 February 2025, 9:30am-11.00am]</strong>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Students tend to face a host of emotional and psychological challenges
as they transit from primary school to secondary school. While this journey
into secondary school can be exciting, some teenagers will require time
to adjust and accommodate to the new environment.
<br>
</p>
<p>To help parents understand the importance of parental support during this
transitional phase of your child, ZSS PSG will be organizing the following
parenting workshop in February:
<br>

your child may encounter during this period of time.
<br>2. Be equipped with the necessary knowledge to support your child in the
secondary school learning environment and help him/her to understand how
better to overcome the various challenges in secondary school.</p>

<p><strong>2.&nbsp;My child wants to enter this school but was not offered a place. How can I appeal for a place?</strong>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>You can register your appeal by submitting the online form linked in Section
4 of this Microsite. In the event there is a vacancy and your child meets
our school's cut-off point, we will contact you as soon as we can.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp; Can I appeal if my child does not meet the cut-off point?</strong>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>You can still register your appeal by submitting the online form linked
in Section 4 of this Microsite. However, we are unlikely to take in students
below the cut-off point as school admissions are based on merit. In the
MOE Secondary One (S1) Posting Exercise, posting decisions are based on
objective and transparent measures of academic merit, i.e. PSLE scores.
Appeals that take place after the S1 Posting Exercise must be aligned to
these principles, in order to be fair to the other admitted students.&nbsp;
Students who would like to gain admission to a secondary school on the
basis of other talents and achievements, e.g. those in sports or arts,
already have the option of an alternative admissions pathway in the form
of the Direct School Admissions Exercise.
<br>
<br>

<p><strong>4.&nbsp; Besides the usual academic pursuits, what are other programmes the school have to stretch the potential of the students to a higher level?</strong>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Annually, we send students for all sorts of competitions and workshops
beyond the school. Subject specific ones include Math and Science Olympiads,
EL Debating and oratorical competitions, MTL oratorical and creative writing
workshops, Humanities Talent Development Programmes. Beyond specific subject
areas, we also identify students to be in our Stretch Programme, where
they are trained to debate on contemporary issues, solve future problems,
and come up with creative solutions. You can read up more on the many awards
that our students have received over the years on our website: /student-achievements/
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>5.&nbsp; How is the school going to provide assistance for academically weaker students?</strong>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Students who need extra help can seek our their subject teachers for after
school consultation.&nbsp; We also have after school remedial lessons to
help those who need that extra academic guidance.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>6.&nbsp; What is the discipline culture of the school?</strong>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Zhenghua is well known in Bukit Panjang for our positive and caring school
culture. All our teachers play a crucial role in ensuring a strong discipline
in Zhenghua through the restorative approach, working together towards
developing all our students into self-disciplined and responsible students
of integrity.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>7.&nbsp; How many of your canteen stalls are Halal? Do your school cater to students who are on vegetarian diet?</strong>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>We have 8 canteen stalls comprising 6 cooked food stalls, 1 cold drinks
and cut fruit stall, and 1 hot drinks and snack stall.&nbsp; Out of the
6 cooked food stalls, 3 are halal certified. Our hot drinks and snack stall
also only sells halal certified snacks such as sandwiches, buns, biscuits,
cakes. We unfortunately do not have a fully vegetarian stall, but the cooked
food stalls do serve purely vegetarian dishes.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>8.&nbsp; What is the school’s stand on outside tuition?</strong>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>We do not recommend our students to go for tuition except for exceptional
cases, e.g. international student struggling with English.&nbsp; The students
should instead approach their teachers for help.&nbsp; We also put in place
several remedial measures for all our students to succeed.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>9.&nbsp; Are mobile phones allowed in the school? What can the school do to prevent excessive mobile phone usage? Why does the school not ban mobile phone use in school?</strong>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Mobile phones are not allowed to be used during curriculum time and will
have to be kept in the student’s locker during lesson time. Phones will
be confiscated by teachers when misused. Students are only allowed to use
their phones before school, during recess and after school.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>10.&nbsp; Who can opt for Higher MTL and where are the lessons held?</strong>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>For your child to take HMTL, your child should meet the following criteria:
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>(i) An overall PSLE Score of 8 or better
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>OR
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>(ii) An overall PSLE Score of 9 to 14 (inclusive); and attain AL 1 / AL
2 in MTL or Distinction / Merit in HMTL.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Students eligible for HMTL will be invited to apply for these programmes
immediately after the release of the PSLE results.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>HML courses will be held in Bukit Panjang Government High, outside curriculum
time and HCL courses will held in our school.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>11.&nbsp; My child does not meet the above criteria to offer HMTL, can my child still opt for HMTL in Secondary School?</strong>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>The school has the flexibility to allow students who do not meet the above
criteria to offer HMTL, if they are assessed to have exceptional ability
in MTL and are able to do HMTL without affecting their performance in other
subjects.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Based on students’ performance in the various weighted assessments throughout
the year, teachers will be able to have a good gauge of their progress.
Students who obtain a grade of A2 and above in MTL in Semester 1 with an
overall average of 60 will be offered HCL in semester 2 in secondary one
in our school.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>At the end of year examination in secondary two, students who have shown
keen interest and have exceptional ability in MTL will be invited to take
a diagnostic test to gauge their ability to cope with the higher level
subject. They will then be offered HMTL in secondary three.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>12.&nbsp; My child is taking Tamil language. When and where are the classes held?</strong>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Students who are offered Tamil will study at the Tamil Language Centre,
Chua Chu Kang Secondary School outside curriculum time. &nbsp;The current
2024 schedule is as follows:
