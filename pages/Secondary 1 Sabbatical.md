|The secondary 1 sabbatical program was successful in improving students' leadership and teamwork skills through a variety of team-building activities such as kinball, archery tag, scavenger hunt, amazing race, and station games. The programme fostered trust, camaraderie, problem-solving, creativity, and effective communication while promoting friendly competition and reflection. The experience was valuable for students' social emotional competencies and growth as relational leaders.|
|I sought new solutions, encouraged teammates after losses, and suggested strategies to overcome challenges. During the hero-themed team bonding games, I facilitated problem-solving by suggesting alternative ways to complete a challenge. I gave my best effort in every activity to ensure the team's success. <br><br>Iva Haney (1G)|
|The sabbatical program helped me understand my classmates' strengths, and I learnt that assigning tasks based on individuals' strengths contributes to an efficient team. I can apply these skills in future group projects, regardless of my familiarity with team members.<br><br>Nur Batrisyia (1E)|
|On hindsight, I realised that we could have approached problems more collaboratively by discussing solutions as a team. Additionally, we could have completed challenges more effectively by prioritising teamwork and working together.<br><br>Kaycia Kwa (1F)|
