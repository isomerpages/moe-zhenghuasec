<p>As part of our endeavour to develop Zhenghua students holistically and
provide bountiful opportunities for them to lead and develop resilience,
our secondary 3 students went on a 4-day 2-night outdoor camp after months
of preparation.</p>

<p>Orienteering at Jurong Lake Gardens was fun. We got to explore the area
and chit-chat but there's more! Bird Paradise was the highlight of the
camp for me. I enjoyed touring around the aviaries and learning more about
the birds, along with the trees and habitats. Sleeping overnight at the
Penguin Cove was a one-of-a-kind experience and a privilege!

<p>Three takeaways from the camp: 1) I learnt how to manage the class showering
time. 2) I learnt the importance of teamwork and integrity within the class,
especially when we need to fulfill a task. 3) I learnt how to adapt to
changes when things do not go according to plan.

<p>Camping with friends was fun and exciting. The Sec 3 camp bonded us as
a class as we each needed to be responsible for a committee and worked
together as a team. It challenged us and pushed us to our limits but that
is how we overcome challenges and build resilience.

<p>Wen we had outdoor cooking during the camp, some people in the F&amp;B
team were absent and there werenâ€™t enough people but our classmates were
willing to work together and and help one another. I made more friends
during this camp and it strengthened my relationship with my class.
