| A student-led event, Student Leaders’ Investiture 2023, shows our appreciation for outgoing leaders. With confident march-ins by new leaders, symbolic object exchanges, and a rousing school song that united the entire school, it was a wonderful showcase of Zhenghua Secondary School’s leadership and excellence.|
|The Investiture was the last occasion that my EXCO members and I worked together so we appreciated the experience more. We felt grateful that we were given the opportunity and were also proud of what we had achieved. We wish the next batch of leaders all the best!<br><br>Victoria Chin Sai Rui (4C)|
|I was happy to participate in investiture, even if it was somewhat nerve-wracking to pass my responsibilities down to my junior. This ceremony is important as it symbolises a change in the leadership of our CCAs. It was an impactful experience handing down the item representing our CCAs along to our juniors. <br><br>Jovin Ong Jing Rui (4C)|
|It has been a while since ZSS celebrated the Student Leaders’ Investiture! The EXCOs planned the event and although it was hard work, we had fun! We felt anxious as everyone was watching us. When the incoming and outgoing leaders met, we shook hands and hugged. We felt emotional, realising that we would be the new leaders of ZSS.<br><br>Nur Aliesha Sabrina Binte Azreen (3D)|
|During the Student Leaders' Investiture, I felt very proud of our seniors and thankful for being seen as someone capable of taking over their role. Walking off at the end, I finally realised it was our time to shine and show the school what we are capable of.<br><br>Loh Xuan Hui, Selina (3C)|
|During the ceremony, mixed feelings rose within me as I watched our seniors step down, but optimism prevailed as it was our turn to lead the CCAs. The token for each CCA had its own significance and it left the deepest impression on me because of how unique that moment was.<br><br>Janelle Lai Yu Tong (3A)|
