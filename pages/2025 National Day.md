<p>Zhenghua Secondary School commemorated Singapore’s 60th National Day with
a vibrant celebration themed Majulah Singapura, reflecting our nation’s
enduring spirit. The day began with a full school March Past, where all
Uniformed Groups displayed discipline and pride in serving the nation.
Students also enjoyed a showcase of cultural performances by Aesthetics
CCAs and volunteer groups in the school hall, celebrating the rich diversity
that defines Singapore. In classrooms, an engaging ICT lesson deepened
students' understanding of our nation-building journey, encouraging reflection
on the values of resilience, boldness, and inclusivity. Together, the school
community celebrated SG60: Building Our Singapore Together, honouring the
past and looking ahead with optimism.</p>

<p>The highlight for me during this year’s NDP preparation was collaborating
with other co-curricular activities (CCAs) and teaching them how to execute
the drills with other key personnel. This experience was especially meaningful
as it brought the different CCAs closer and gave everyone the sense that,
although we come from different CCAs, we can work together and strive as
one. These sessions also gave me the opportunity to showcase my passion
for drills and provided a platform for me to learn how to teach them more
effectively.</p>

<p>To me, the National Day Parade means coming together with all the other
uniformed groups, working hard, and showing our skills and resilience through
drills. It is about supporting one another through tough times, rain or
shine, overcoming challenges with a smile, and being proud to be in a uniform
group. Most importantly, it is about working towards a shared goal and
showcasing a wonderful parade to celebrate our country’s birthday together.</p>

<p>National Day reminds us of our pioneers’ struggles and determination in
building our nation. Preparing for the parade symbolises that same spirit.
It teaches us to face challenges head-on and persevere. Even when things
get tough, we must stay committed and work together to achieve our common
goal of putting on a great parade.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The National Day Concert was one of the most enjoyable moments I’ve experienced
this year. My favourite part was when the whole school stood up to sing
the national anthem. It gave me a deep sense of pride in the nation we
call home. Hearing so many voices in harmony was truly priceless. The moment
I want to remember most is when the school shouted, “Happy National Day!”
I felt incredibly proud to be Singaporean, and as I looked around, I saw
joyful faces everywhere. I had never seen the students so elated, which
made the moment even more special. Overall, the concert made me feel joyful
and proud. Seeing everyone smile and cheer for our nation was heartwarming.
It reminded me of the tremendous effort Singapore has put into becoming
what it is today, and I felt truly grateful.</p>
