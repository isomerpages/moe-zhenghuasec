<p>Zhenghua Secondary School commemorated Singapore’s 60th National Day with
a vibrant celebration themed Majulah Singapura, reflecting our nation’s
enduring spirit. The day began with a full school March Past, where all
Uniformed Groups displayed discipline and pride in serving the nation.
Students also enjoyed a showcase of cultural performances by Aesthetics
CCAs and volunteer groups in the school hall, celebrating the rich diversity
that defines Singapore. In classrooms, an engaging ICT lesson deepened
students' understanding of our nation-building journey, encouraging reflection
on the values of resilience, boldness, and inclusivity. Together, the school
community celebrated SG60: Building Our Singapore Together, honouring the
past and looking ahead with optimism.</p>

<p>The highlight for me during this year’s NDP preparation was collaborating
with other co-curricular activities (CCAs) and teaching them how to execute
the drills with other key personnel. This experience was especially meaningful
as it brought the different CCAs closer and gave everyone the sense that,
although we come from different CCAs, we can work together and strive as
one. These sessions also gave me the opportunity to showcase my passion
for drills and provided a platform for me to learn how to teach them more
effectively.</p>

<p>To me, the National Day Parade means coming together with all the other
uniformed groups, working hard, and showing our skills and resilience through
drills. It is about supporting one another through tough times, rain or
shine, overcoming challenges with a smile, and being proud to be in a uniform
group. Most importantly, it is about working towards a shared goal and
showcasing a wonderful parade to celebrate our country’s birthday together.</p>
