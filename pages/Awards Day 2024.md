<p>This yearâ€™s Awards Day took place on the 3 May 2024. We celebrated the
academic success and contributions from the 2023 batch of students. The
evening ended with a spectacular concert celebrating out 25<sup>th</sup> anniversary.
It was a fantastic showcase of the diverse talents and CCAs of ZSS!</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Awards Day served as a motivation for us to continue to work hard
to prepare for our national examination this year. It was inspiring to
celebrate the achievements of our seniors in 2023.

<p>It was a memorable evening my CCA mates and me. We participated in the
25th anniversary concert after the Awards Day. Everyone was thrilled to
end the evening with a great performance after weeks of preparation.

<p>It was great to see the seniors coming back on Awards Day. We were glad
to learn more about where they were posted to after graduating. It is definitely
a must for Secondary 4 students to attend this event!
