|Racial Harmony Day 2023| 
| -------- | 
|This year's theme for Racial Harmony Day was 'Our Mulitcultural Mosaic'.|
|![](/images/rhd202301.jpg)|
|The theme reflects how each community, while having the space to express its own identity as part of Singapore society, also intertwines with others to depict the unique cultural diversity that characterises Singapore life. The overall picture may change with time as our society evolves, like all societies do, but the hues will continue to complement one another because of our long-shared history and heritage. This is Singaporeâ€™s bespoke approach towards multiculturalism and social cohesion, where the experiences of every individual matter and add to our diversity.<br><br>Zhenghua Secondary School organised the Best Dressed Class Competition to showcase class spirit and creativity in our diverse community.&nbsp; Students could think out of the box to express their understanding of social harmony and take this great opportunity to foster better relationships with their peers.|
|This is a very fun activity for everyone to know the culture behind the clothes and to embrace diversity <br><br>Randall Ho (3A)|
