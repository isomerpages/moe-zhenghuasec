<p>Our school's Lunar New Year celebration was a day filled with excitement
and meaningful activities, with special invitations extended to the Parent
Support Group and alumni to join in the festivities. In the morning, students
wrapped hampers with donations to be given to low-income families and crafted
creative costumes out of red packets. The highlight of the day was the
concert, which featured incredible performances by both teachers and students.
Two of our very own students were part of the spectacular Lion Dance segment,
adding an electrifying energy to the event that had everyone cheering!
It was a wonderful blend of fun, culture, and giving back to the community,
made even more memorable by the teamwork and dedication of everyone.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed the hamper wrapping activity as it gave me the chance
to bond with my classmates and friends. I also loved the lion dance segment
because it was so lively and exciting! My class was seated in the gallery
and we had a bird’s eye view of the entire concert. While sitting in the
gallery was a more relaxed experience, I did miss the chance to interact
with the performers and catch the sweets that the mascot threw into the
crowd. Despite this, I still had a great time, especially with the red
packet costume catwalk—it was definitely a highlight!</p>

<p>The Chinese New Year Festival was a truly enjoyable celebration for me,
filled with unique events and activities that brought my class together.
I learned how to collaborate effectively with my teammates, which led us
to successfully create a beautifully arranged hamper. I had a great time
during the concert as well, and I hope the school will organise more festive
activities like this in the future.</p>

<p>For Chinese New Year, we started by making hampers using the generous
food donations from our class. It was heartwarming to see everyone come
together to contribute. We then decorated the hampers with personalised
cards and angbaos, adding a special touch. I truly enjoyed this activity
as it gave me an opportunity to bond with my classmates and work together
on something meaningful. Not only was it fun, but it also filled me with
a deep sense of gratitude, knowing that the hampers we created would be
given to low-income families. I’m thankful for the chance to be part of
such a thoughtful and impactful initiative, which made the celebration
even more memorable.</p>

<p>One of the highlights of the Chinese New Year Festival celebrations was
the concert. The variety of performances was outstanding, and the emcees
did an excellent job introducing the different segments, including the
CNY Quiz. I was especially captivated by the Drum Ensemble's performance,
and I couldn’t help but sing along to the teachers' performance. It was
also incredibly entertaining to admire the creative costumes each class
had put together. The costumes were truly impressive, ranging from suits
of armor and elegant dresses to even a set of wings. I think it would be
fantastic if we could make red packet costume fashion a tradition here
at ZSS, as it would be a fun and unique way to celebrate in the future!</p>
