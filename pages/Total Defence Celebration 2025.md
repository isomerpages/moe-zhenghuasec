<p>As part of Zhenghua Secondary School's celebration of Total Defence Day
(TDD) and Exercise SG Ready (ESR) 2025, students took part in a Water Disruption
Simulation where they learnt the importance of water conservation and resilience.
They also enjoyed a captivating interactive theatre performance of <em>The Redhill: A Singapore Folktale</em>,
connecting them to Singaporeâ€™s cultural heritage and the 6 Pillars of Total
Defence (Military, Civil, Economic, Social, Digital and Psychological Defence).&nbsp;</p>

<p>I learnt that Water Disruption can bring inconvenience to our daily lives
and we need to be prepared for this kind of crisis at all times.&nbsp;
It happened to Bukit Panjang residents not too long ago, and they had to
collect clean water using pails and buckets at the void deck of HDB flats.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I learnt that if water disruption can happen, then energy disruption is
also possible.&nbsp; I cannot imagine how to survive without electricity,
which means no wifi and data for my mobile phone. We must conserve energy
and have alternative supply of energy such as solar energy.</p>
