|Our Hari Raya live concert aims to rekindle the spirit and tradition of Hari Raya post-pandemic. <br><br>For this yearâ€™s Hari Raya, we hope to relive the customary habits of the festivities, so as to cultivate in everyone a deeper appreciation of the Hari Raya celebration.|
|The concert was exciting but nerve wracking for me as I was one of the emcees. Having two actual days to rehearse was a challenge, but the experience was worthwhile when I saw how the audience enjoyed our performances and interaction with them!<br><br>Muhd Aif Dafi Abdullah (1F)|
|I am glad to be part of the drums &amp; angklung contingent for the concert as I experience camaraderie among my drums members and ZSS students. I hope to be part of more interactive and live school events in the future.<br><br>Mohd Qusyairi (1A)|
|The Hari Raya concert was really fun and I enjoyed it very much; the interactive skit made it even more entertaining. I really hope we can have more events like these moving forward!<br><br>Ray Kuck (1E)|
|As a new leader of the Drums Ensemble, the Hari Raya concert was a key event for me to lead my drummers in our live school performance post-pandemic. Although most of us were playing the angklung for the first time, I think it was a great finale!<br><br>Nurul Atiqah (3B)|
|I was lucky to have the chance to put on the samping and strut on stage, and it was more comfortable than I expected. &nbsp;I enjoyed the informative and interactive quizzes as well as the interactive performances by our juniors!<br><br>Tristan Lee (4F)|
