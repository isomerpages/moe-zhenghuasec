<p>Our secondary one students went through a 4-day programme during Ziesta
to help them discover and develop their strengths and areas for growth.
On the first day, students went through a profiling workshop to discover
their own strengths and areas of growth. Armed with a better understanding
of themselves, they set off on 3 days of enriching teambuilding activities.</p>

<p>I have discovered that each of us have unique talents, as well as different
strengths. I found out that my biggest strength can be applied to different
situations which is very helpful.

<p>I discovered that I like working in teams as it made me feel that everyone
has a part to play and no one is left out. During the Amazing Race, we
had a lot of opportunities to show our teamwork as all of the stations
required different types of skill sets. I realised that even if there are
some of us who are not that good at certain tasks, there will still be
others in the team who can help out.

<p>I discovered how to use my strengths to help me in my daily life and how
I can improve them.
