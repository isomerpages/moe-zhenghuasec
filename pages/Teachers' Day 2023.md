|Teachers' Day Celebration  2023|
|--|
|Teachers’ Day this year was organised by Student Councillors based on the theme “Teachers, Our Superheroes”. The day began with class parties organised by each class committee. Then, instead of a single concert, there were 2 concurrent concerts at the Indoor Sports Hall with performances by students, teachers, alumni and the Drama Club as well as fun interclass party games. It ended with our annual Teachers’ Day awards and gifts to show our appreciation to our teachers for all their hard work.

|I never thought that as a secondary 1 Student Councillor, I would have the opportunity to plan the programmes for my first Teacher’s Day celebration at Zhenghua Secondary School. This experience was definitely one of the most memorable so far as it was such a big event. While overcoming challenges like poor communication, I was able to learn to manage myself and be more productive. I really feel like this experience has helped me grow in many ways; it really tested my creativity and adaptability. I hope that I get to plan a big event like this again.<br><br>Naufal Al-Aqil Bin Sutrayetno(1C)|
|This Teachers’ Day has allowed me to learn many new skills and it made me understand how difficult it can be organising an event. I was the emcee and part of the information team. Even though there were many last-minute changes, we persevered and made one of the most memorable Teachers’ Days for me and others. Being the emcee was something new and exciting and I loved working with my partner Valerie. I also made new friends along the way. Thanks to this event, I was able to learn new things and skills I was not able to learn within the classroom.<br><br>Janis Chan (2E) |
|This was actually my second time helping Teachers’ Day concert. The first time was when I was in sec 2 but it was much harder and scarier this year as I was the IC for Logistics. I was in charge of items like the superhero capes for the emcees and the goodie bags. I did not know what gifts I should buy that were both in line with the superhero theme and within the budget. However, with the help of my juniors and our teacher mentors, we were able to buy the gifts that we thought the teachers would like. However, this was not the hardest part as the team and I had to sort out hundreds of Teachers’ Day cards and divide them into stacks for each individual teacher in the school. It was nerve-racking as we had a lot of work to do in such a short time, but by working and communicating with one another, we were able to sort the cards out properly. This experience helped me learn how to stay calm during tough situations.<br><br>Muhammad Irfan Nurhakim (3B)|
|This was my first time organising this Teachers’ Day event as a 2nd IC. It was a difficult journey but on the actual day, it was great. During the planning phase, we had to organise different sub-groups like Logistics, Programme and Information. As a 2nd IC, I had to work with our 1st IC, Vienna, to give each team weekly goals and give reminders to keep everyone on track. On the last day of the preparation, there were many last-minute changes that were unforeseen so we had to make adjustments on the day itself. It was challenging but our efforts paid off and everyone had a great time on the actual day. All in all, I would have to say this experience helped me learn how to deal with unexpected changes.<br><br>Zack Tan (3B)|
