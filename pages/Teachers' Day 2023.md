|Teachers' Day Celebration  2023|
|--|
|Teachers’ Day this year was organised by Student Councillors based on the theme “Teachers, Our Superheroes”. The day began with class parties organised by each class committee. Then, instead of a single concert, there were 2 concurrent concerts at the Indoor Sports Hall with performances by students, teachers, alumni and the Drama Club as well as fun interclass party games. It ended with our annual Teachers’ Day awards and gifts to show our appreciation to our teachers for all their hard work.

|I never thought that as a secondary 1 Student Councillor, I would have the opportunity to plan the programmes for my first Teacher’s Day celebration at Zhenghua Secondary School. This experience was definitely one of the most memorable so far as it was such a big event. While overcoming challenges like poor communication, I was able to learn to manage myself and be more productive. I really feel like this experience has helped me grow in many ways; it really tested my creativity and adaptability. I hope that I get to plan a big event like this again.<br><br>Naufal Al-Aqil Bin Sutrayetno(1C)|
|Volleyball with my classmates was an exhilarating experience. The atmosphere was charged with energy and friendly competition as we showcased our skills on the court. It was amazing to see teamwork and strength among the other classes. I enjoyed it very much.<br><br>Chan Weng Xuen (2D) |
|I had an absolute blast participating in the Sports Fiesta. It exposed me to a new sport. The teamwork among the class, the rush of chasing the ball, and the excitement of scoring a goal made it an unforgettable experience.<br><br>Pek Keng Oon (3F)|
