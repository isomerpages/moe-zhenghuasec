### Secondary 2 Drama Workshop

|  |  |
|---|---|
| In February 2022, our Secondary Two students<br> participated in a drama workshop to bring their<br> Literature text to life! In the three days, the students<br> learnt the fundamentals of drama and performance,<br> such as freeze frames, thought-tracking and improvisation,<br> as well as the various elements of drama production.<br> Immersing themselves into the roles of crew and actors,<br> our students worked together to perform scenes from<br> the play “Don’t Know, Don’t Care” by Haresh Sharma and <br>proved their acting talent through spirited monologues<br> and dramatic performances.<br><br>It was encouraging to see how our students were able to <br>develop their confidence in expressing themselves in public,<br> as well as their high engagement in the process of <br>meaning-making through dramatization. Some even asked <br>to have more of such activities across the year! It was <br>encouraging for teachers and students alike to see the latter<br> stepping out of their comfort zone to participate keenly in <br>these new experiences of performance, and more importantly, <br>to have fun while learning.| <img src="/images/sec%202%20drama%201.jpg" style="width:65%"><br><br><img src="/images/sec%202%20drama%202.jpg" style="width:65%"><br><br><img src="/images/sec%202%20drama%203.jpg" style="width:65%">
