<p>(2) My Child wants to enter this school but was not offered a place during
the Sec 1 posting exercise. How can I appeal for a place?</p>
<p>You can register your appeal by approaching our staff in the General Office,
and your child will be put on our waiting list. The online form will be
made available after the release of the posting results in December. In
the event that your child/ward is shortlisted, we will contact you as soon
as we can.</p>
<p>(3) I am a Returning Singaporean, how can i apply for a place in Zhenghua
Secondary School?</p>
<p>The School Placement Exercise for Returning Singaporeans (SPERS) was introduced
to facilitate the school admission of Returning Singaporean (RS) children
who are Singapore Citizen or Permanent Resident, returning from overseas
and wish to join our mainstream schools.If your child has lived and studied
overseas and do not have a place in a local secondary school, you may sit
for the SPERS - Secondary to seek admission into Secondary 1-3 in the following
academic year. In view that the Secondary 4 is a national examination year,
we would generally not encourage Returning Singaporeans to seek admission
at this level.</p>
<p>(4) What is the criteria for Direct School Admission into Zhenghua Secondary
School?</p>
<p>We take in promising Primary 6 students with strong leadership qualities
and/or outstanding contributions to their uniformed groups, CCAs or school
through the school’s Direct School Admission (DSA) exercise. Further details
can be found on our DSA page&nbsp;<a href="https://www.zhenghuasec.moe.edu.sg/dsa/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>
</p>
<p>(5) What is the school's stand on outside tuition?</p>
<p>We do not recommend our students to go for tuition except in exceptional
cases.&nbsp; The students should instead approach their teachers for help.&nbsp;
We also put in place several remedial measures to help our students succeed.</p>
<p>(6) Are handphones allowed in the school? What can the school do to prevent
excessive handphone usage?</p>
<p>Handphones are not allowed to be used during curriculum time unless allowed
by the teacher for teaching and learning purposes. Students are only allowed
to use their handphones before school, during recess and after school.
We do not ban the use of handphones as we would rather educate our students
to use their personal devices responsibly in a world that is increasingly
dependent on technology. We thus conduct cyber-wellness lessons and workshops
for such a purpose.</p>
<p>(7) Will teachers use Facebook or other social media and Whatsapp to communicate
with the students?</p>
<p>While we do not encourage our teachers to use social media to communicate
with students, we do recognise that technological platforms can be a useful
platform to encourage student online discussions and collaborations.&nbsp;
Hence, unless it is for educational purposes, our teachers will not use
social media platforms to communicate with your child.We also recognise
that online communication apps like Whatsapp are effective ways to get
in touch with students. However, teachers do recognise that not all students
have smart phones or data plans and that Whatsapp only serve as an additional
form of communication on top of those we already have in class and in school.</p>
<p>(8) When my child is sick, can I just write a letter instead of providing
an MC as they have medication at home?</p>
<p>We seek your kind understanding to always get a doctor to look into the
health and well-being of your child when he or she is sick and to obtain
an MC if he or she is unable to attend school. We accept parent letters
only after establishing with you the situation that your child is in.</p>
<p>(9) If we want to apply leave for my child, what must we do?</p>
<p>If your child is sick, please consult a doctor to obtain an MC. If there
are other forms of emergencies (e.g. bereavement of a family member), please
write a letter to inform your child’s form teachers about the duration
which your child needs to be away.&nbsp; We seek your understanding to
not take your child out of school for holidays during curriculum time as
this would have an impact on his or her studies.</p>
<p>(10) Who can opt for Higher MTL and where are the lessons held?</p>
<p>Students who offer Mother Tongue Language (MTL) (i.e. Chinese/ Malay/
Tamil) or Higher Mother Tongue Language (HTML) (i.e. Higher Chinese/ Higher
Malay/ Higher Tamil) at the PSLE and</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>are ranked among the top 10% of the PSLE; OR</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>are in the top 11% - 30% band who meet the language criteria (i.e. an
A* grade in the MTL or at least a Merit in the HMTL), may opt to study
HMTL at secondary schools. They may offer English Language and HMTL in
the GCE ‘O’ Level Examination at the end of Secondary Four.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Students eligible for HMTL will be invited to apply for these programmes
immediately after the release of the PSLE results.</p>
<p>Higher Malay Language course will be held in Bukit Panjang Government
High outside curriculum time and Higher Chinese Language course is held
in the school.</p>
<p>(11) My child does not meet the above criteria to offer HMTL, can my child
still opt for HMTL in Secondary School?</p>
<p>The school has the flexibility to allow students who do not meet the above
criteria to offer HMTL, if they are assessed to have exceptional ability
in MTL in the mid-year examination and are able to do HMTL without affecting
their performance in other subjects.Students who obtain a grade of A2 and
above in MTL in the mid-year examination with an overall average of 60
will be offered HCL in semester 2 in secondary one in our school.</p>
<p>(12) My child is taking Tamil language. When and where are the classes
held?</p>
<p>Students who are offered Tamil will study at the Tamil Language Centre,
Teck Whye Secondary School outside curriculum time. For 2024, depending
on the level and stream, Tamil classes will commence at 3pm on the following
days:</p>

<p>(13) My child takes part in a competitive sport on a regular basis (e.g.
gymnastics, swimming) but this sport is not offered in the school. Can
it be counted as my child's CCA?</p>
<p>In order for the child to achieve an excellent grade in CCA, the child
must take part in a CCA that is offered by the school, and have attended
at least 75% of that CCA’s activities during his or her time in the school.
The child’s involvement in outside activities such as competitive sports
can help the child achieve higher attainment points in the CCA grading
system known as LEAPS. The school can also help to de-conflict the child’s
CCA in school with his or her outside commitments if need be.(<em>For questions on specific CCAs, please contact any of the CCA teachers-in-charge or our HOD/PE&amp;CCA Mr Robin Goh.</em>)</p>
