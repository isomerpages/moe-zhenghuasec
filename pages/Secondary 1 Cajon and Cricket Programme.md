|Over the course of Term 2, our Sec 1s prepared for a showcase concert which took place during ZIESTA, captivating the audience with their cajon skills. They also embraced the spirit of sportsmanship through cricket, participating in inter-class friendly matches.|

|The cajon performance was a refreshing musical experience, despite a few nervous mistakes made. Learning a new instrument brought discovery, while fostering teamwork and leadership skills. Similarly, the cricket programme provided a refreshing and enjoyable introduction to the sport, promoting friendly competition and skill development.<br><br>Muhd Aif Dafi Abdullah (1F)|
|As the cajon concert emcee, I learnt to confidently project my voice and persevere through mistakes. It was a valuable lesson in public speaking and building self-assurance. For the cricket programme, I applied PE skills, bonded with my classmates, and made new friends during the inter-class competition. These activities fostered our growth and expanded our knowledge.<br><br>Chen Jizhou (1A)|
|I'm proud of my classâ€™ progress made in playing the cajon with a backing track. Overcoming challenges, we delivered a successful performance through dedicated practice. Watching other classes perform was fascinating, with standout ensembleship from 1C. They performed without backing tracks and left a lasting impression on the audience. Initially, I found cricket boring but I changed my perspective as I dedicated time and effort into learning it. Mastering the skills brought a sense of accomplishment.<br><br>Izanne Goh Zhuo Lin (1D)|
