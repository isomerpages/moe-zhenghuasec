<p>On&nbsp;this special day, we came together as a school community to celebrate
more than just achievements — we celebrated growth, grit, and the spirit
of partnership. From dynamic learners to exemplary leaders and thoughtful
contributors, our Zhenghua students continue to embody our values and vision
for the future. A heartfelt thank you to our community partners and families
who walk this journey with us. Your support empowers our students to thrive
and shine!</p>

<p>Awards Day was memorable as I was able to witness my seniors' achievements
and awards. The dance performance was a good showcase of the talents of
our students. I felt that overall, it was an interesting experience.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was very touching because it wasn’t just about the award recipients
— it also gave a deep insight into how the students felt about the school,
their contributions to the community, and their CCAs. I think it was amazing
because it gave everyone a better understanding of our school life.</p>
