|  |  |
|---|---|
| An annual 3-day event, the Secondary One<br> Orientation camp was held from the 5th to 7th of <br>January this year to integrate the new cohort of <br>students into the Zhenghua Secondary School family. <br><br> Packed with a myriad of innovative and mind-stretching<br> games, _Camp Alacrity_ helped the newbies familiarise<br> themselves with the school environment and seal<br> lasting friendships with members of the institution.<br><br>One activity that undoubtedly grabbed the attention<br> of everyone on the first day was Crime Scene <br>Investigation. It was heartening to see the Secondary<br> Ones interacting enthusiastically with one another<br> in solving the mind-boggling mystery that was gamely<br> presented to them by the student leaders.<br><br>The second day proved to be even more fulfilling and<br> memorable as the students tried their hands at outdoor<br> cooking with their classmates, which was a first for<br> most of them. The school certainly has some chefs<br> in the making!<br><br>_Camp Alacrity_ ended with a video montage featuring<br> interviews with the teachers, Secondary Ones and<br> Student Leaders who were involved in the camp.  <br>Prizes and certificates were also awarded to the Secondary Ones. | <img src="/images/sec%201%20orientation%20camp%201.jpg" style="width:90%"> <br><br> <img src="/images/zhn%20sec%201%20orientation%20camp%202.jpg" style="width:65%"><br><br><img src="/images/zhn%20sec%201%20orientation%20camp%203.jpg" style="width:90%">
