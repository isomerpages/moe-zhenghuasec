<p>Uniformed group members conducted a Total Defence Card Game Challenge
on 29 Feb 2024 to raise awareness on how they can better prepare themselves
for emergencies and protect Singapore.</p>
<p>I learnt that it is important for all 6 pillars of Total Defence to work
together in order to solve any crisis. I also learnt that it is important
for all Singaporeans to unite as one to help and support one another and
stay strong in times of crisis.

<p>We bonded with the Red Cross members during the game and expanded our
social circle. This makes the uniformed groups more united.

<p>Teaching the Red Cross cadets how to play the game was fun. I enjoyed
how they kept asking questions which showed that they were really interested
in the card game and willing to learn.
