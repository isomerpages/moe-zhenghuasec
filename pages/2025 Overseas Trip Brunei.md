<p><strong>Bridging Hearts: Singapore-Brunei School Immersion Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Secondary 3 students embarked on a 5-day immersion trip to Brunei,
experiencing local school life, cultural sites, and hands-on activities
like rice farming. Students explored iconic landmarks, engaged with Bruneian
peers, and gained insights into the country's unique heritage and lifestyle.</p>

<p>The padi field experience was unforgettable. Even when it started to rain,
we continued planting rice in the mud. It was my first time doing something
like that, and I realised how much love and effort go into farming. Although
we ended up wet and dirty, the experience created lasting memories and
taught me to appreciate the hard work behind our food.</p>

<p>Visiting the Bruneian school changed my perspective. Although their learning
pace was different and students shared laptops instead of using personal
devices, the lessons were engaging and interactive. The experience taught
me not to judge too quickly and showed me that different ways of learning
can be equally effective.</p>

<p>Before going to Brunei, I thought the trip would be boring and uneventful.
Instead, it turned out to be a journey filled with challenges, joy, and
even moments of sadness. From exploring the water village to bonding with
local students, the experience taught me the importance of being open-minded
and appreciating different perspectives.</p>
