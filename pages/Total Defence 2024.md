<p>Total Defence 2024 commemorated the 40th Anniversary of Total Defence
in Singapore with interesting and engaging activities such as Food Resilience
Experience and Drama performance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We got to experience Ready-To-Eat meals sent by Singapore Food Agency
(SFA) and the taste of the food was something new to me.

<p>The food tasted good and I wanted more.&nbsp; It made me realise that
food disruption could be very serious to Singapore and we need to reduce
food wastage.&nbsp;

<p>I learnt that the Singapore government put in a lot of effort to create
Ready-To-Eat meals to get Singapore prepared for any crisis.

<p>I learnt that we should not waste food and we should be ever ready for
any crisis to happen in Singapore.&nbsp;
