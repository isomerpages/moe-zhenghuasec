<p>The annual Secondary 1 Orientation Camp was filled with much fun, excitement
and laughter. Themed ‘Team Venture’, it symbolises the Secondary One students
advancing to a new chapter, the beginning of a new journey. The camp revolved
around getting the Secondary Ones to discover themselves, others, and their
environment.</p>

<p>The most memorable part of Camp Venture was the camp finale which saw
everyone having fun. During the camp, I felt that the camp committee was
very united; we talked, laughed, danced and had lots of fun together. It
was joyous when we saw that the activities we planned for two months come
to life. I hope that the camp committee would be able to work together
as a team again in upcoming school events.</p>

<p>The most memorable part of the camp wass meeting new friends and I like
the ‘Capture the Cone’ activity because we got to work as a team to capture
the other teams’ cone through teamwork which I think is important.</p>

<p>I enjoyed the camp because all the facilitators and teachers were nice
and caring. On Day 1, we had a lot of fun activities that really bonded
the class together. Although meeting new classmates can be difficult as
everyone is so shy, the orientation camp really helped to build friendships
in 1D. Staying overnight was great as it gave an opportunity to those students
who might not have had the chance to do so before. For me, the class cheer
was the best part of the camp as it made me feel like everyone was getting
along as a class.</p>
