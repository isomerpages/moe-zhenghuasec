<p>The Student Leaders' Investiture celebrates the appointment of student
leaders in their respective co-curricular activities. This ceremony marks
the beginning of their leadership journey as they strive to inspire others
and make meaningful contributions to the school community.</p>
<p>Standing on stage during the investiture was a nerve-wracking yet proud
moment. I realised the weight of responsibility and trust that the school
has placed in me. I have big shoes to fill, and I will do my best to carry
on the legacy left by our seniors. To me, leading the Student Council is
not about the title, but about the teamwork, values, and service we offer
to the school. I look forward to working with both students and teachers
to make our school an even better place. With open-mindedness and dedication,
I hope to lead by example and make a positive difference in our school.</p>

<p>The Student Leaders' Investiture was an experience I will never forget.
I remember seeing many of my friends cheering me on as I walked up on stage
with the others. I felt excited, and it was a life-changing moment for
me as I was given the honour of being the Band Major for the year 2025â€“2026.
Although reciting the pledge was the most challenging part, it was still
a meaningful moment as we began our journey as leaders.</p>

<p>Watching the Secondary 4s hand over the baton of legacy to the Secondary
3s during the investiture reminded me of the moment I took up my own leadership
role. I would like to thank the extraordinary Secondary 4 leaders for their
hard work and dedication and to the capable Secondary 3 leaders, I believe
you will carry on the legacy we have built. All the best!</p>

<p>As I walked across the hall towards the stage to receive my token, a sense
of relief washed over me. My journey as a student leader had come to an
end. The title I had carried with pride would finally be lifted, and all
my hard work was about to be recognised and appreciated. I felt proud and
content, knowing I had served my school with dedication and heart.</p>
