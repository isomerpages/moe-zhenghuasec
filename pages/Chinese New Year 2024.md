<p>To commemorate ZSS's 25th anniversary this year, we extended invitations
to the members of the School Advisory Committee, Parent Support Group,
and alumni to join us in celebrating the Lunar New Year at the parade square.
The festivities were rich with cultural vibrancy, featuring a captivating
concert and a mass 'Lo-hei' session. It's worth noting that the event was
a collaborative effort, meticulously planned and executed by leaders from
the uniformed groups and the student councillor committee. Their active
involvement ensured a memorable and inclusive celebration for the school
community.</p>
<p>Working on this event as the crowd management IC has been both enjoyable
yet eye opening. As it was my first time helping to run an event, I have
learnt that crowd management is not as easy as it seems. I had to manage
physical logistics, my own team, while envisioning a perfect yet feasible
sequence of events. I have gained a new-found appreciation for our teachers
and the school, who frequently put in the time and effort to plan and run
events for us. Overall, I am thankful for this new experience and I got
closer to those whom I worked with to put on a good show. I hope for more
of such opportunities to come my way.

<p>The CNY celebration was amazing! The lion dance performance exceeded my
expectations and there was a God of Wealth (Cai Shen Ye) giving out candy.
I managed to catch one! It was an even bigger surprise when they announced
that two of the lion dancers were our students. Another activity was the
lantern making competition. Unfortunately, my class did not win but we
tried our best and that was all that matters. After that, the school dancers
performed to an upbeat CNY song. The last segment was the lohei and I wished
for prosperity for the year!

<p>The CNY celebration started off with a lantern making competition. All
the beautiful lanterns made by the classes were hung at the back of the
parade square. A captivating lion dance performance followed the competition.
Thereafter, we watched performances by our school’s dance and drums ensemble
CCA. All the performers worked really hard to put up a good show. The finale
was a mass lohei. The celebration went smoothly and it would not have been
possible without the hard work put in by our student leaders and teachers.

<p>2月9日，我校举办了新年庆祝会。我们早上的活动是使用红包封来做灯笼，这些作品都挂在操场上，让全校观赏。每个班都很有活力，有的班还做出了一条长长的活灵活现的龙！紧接着是我们新年表演的时间，我觉得整场表演下来，最让我惊叹的是舞蹈和马来鼓的表演。舞者伴随着欢快的音乐，带着灿烂的笑容，为大家送上了新春的祝福。紧接着，鼓手们穿着传统节日的服装整齐地排成一列，为全校师生献上振奋人心的表演。为了庆祝新年和校庆，表演之后全校一起捞鱼生。大盘又可口的捞鱼生放在桌子上，大家都开始流口水了。当每个人都开始一边捞鱼生一边喊着新年快乐恭喜发财，新年的氛围达到了最高点。今年的新年庆祝会不同于以往，使我们眼前一亮，我在这里祝大家新年快乐，学业进步！

<p>一转眼就到了大年三十，我和同学们一起在学校庆祝新年的到来。今年也是25周年校庆，因此在制作灯笼后，我们去广场观看我为新年以及校庆特别准备的节目。首先出场的是舞狮表演，它们的灵活可爱让人眼前一亮，我也第一次在看懂了舞狮表演的故事。当舞狮站起来采青的时候，大家的心也都跟着悬了起来！我还接到了财神爷丢的糖，也代表接到了好运。另一个让我难忘的是整班围在桌子旁，把鱼生捞得很高。听说鱼生捞得越高，愿望就越能成真。这一天就在欢快的气氛中结束了，每个人都玩的很开心，希望每年都有这样的活动！
