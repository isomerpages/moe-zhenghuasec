<p>Being the Parade Commander for this year's NDP has been an unforgettable
experience. It has showed me the importance of organisation and community
spirit and taught me how to how to work better with others. I am truly
honoured to have taken on this role and it has honed my leadership skills
and built my character.

<p>Being the 2nd IC for this year’s NDP gave me the opportunity to command
the colour party. The experience has taught me resilience as I strived
to make every rehearsal better than the last. I also learnt to be diligent,
to consistently give of my best. It was a great learning experience from
the first rehearsal right up to the day of the parade.
