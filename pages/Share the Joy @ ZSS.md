|![](/images/sharethejoy%20mainpic.jpg) For this year's CNY Values in Action project, Class 5A managed the donation project together with the teachers. ZSS collected a total of 67 food hampers and 27 gift packages for the residents in our neighbourhood! |
|CNY VIA Reflections|
|"In the past, I thought i couldn't help those who are needy because i'm only a secondary student with little money to donate. This CNY VIA opened my eyes to see that if we have the heart to help, we can come up with ideas to help these residents. I learnt that teamwork makes dream work. Everyone in the school can come together and we succeeded in delivering many hampers so that the residents can celebrate a happy Chinese New Year."<br><br>Thin Yoke Yi|
|"I used to think that since Singapore is a wealthy country, there aren't people living in poverty. I assumed most people had a job and earned an average wage. However, this CNY VIA made me realise that there are people who need financial assistance. There are people who don't live in great conditions and some of them don't even have an actual bed. I feel priviledged compared to them and I'm thankful for the communities that work together to help these less privileged people."<br><br>Valerie Ong|
