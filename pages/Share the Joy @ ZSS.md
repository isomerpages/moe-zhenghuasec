|![](/images/sharethejoy%20mainpic.jpg) For this year's CNY Values in Action project, Class 5A managed the donation project together with the teachers. ZSS collected a total of 67 food hampers and 27 gift packages for the residents in our neighbourhood! |
|CNY VIA Reflections|
|![](/images/sharethejoy1.jpg)"In the past, I thought i couldn't help those who are needy because i'm only a secondary student with little money to donate. This CNY VIA opened my eyes to see that if we have the heart to help, we can come up with ideas to help these residents. I learnt that teamwork makes dream work. Everyone in the school can come together and we succeeded in delivering many hampers so that the residents can celebrate a happy Chinese New Year."<br><br>Thin Yoke Yi|
|![](/images/sharethejoy2.jpg)"I used to think that since Singapore is a wealthy country, there aren't people living in poverty. I assumed most people had a job and earned an average wage. However, this CNY VIA made me realise that there are people who need financial assistance. There are people who don't live in great conditions and some of them don't even have an actual bed. I feel priviledged compared to them and I'm thankful for the communities that work together to help these less privileged people."<br><br>Valerie Ong|
|![](/images/sharethejoy3.jpg)"When I was in secondary four, I thought that food would not help those people in need much. Now I learnt that the food that we students donate would actually help them a lot as these residents would not need to buy these daily necessities that we are donating to them."<br><br>Javier Yeo|
|![](/images/sharethejoy5.jpg)"This year's CNY was really early so it was a huge rush to get this project up and running but our 5A students really showed great team spirit in pulling it off. Everyone contributed in the collection and delivery process as well as the taking of photographs and coming up with a publicity video. Delivering the hampers was tough work but everyone was joyous when we saw the smiles on the faces of the residents when they were presented with the hampers. Good job 5A!<br><br>Ms Rachel Tan (Form Teacher, 5A)|
