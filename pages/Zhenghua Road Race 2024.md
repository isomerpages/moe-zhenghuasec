<p>Our Zhenghua Road Race was held on 23 May 2024 at the Sports Hub (OCBC
Square). Students from all levels ran a 2.8km route from the Sports hub
to Tanjong Rhu Promenade and back. Our Parent Support Group and alumni
were also invited for the event. Besides running, students also tried to
complete a Zhenghua Secondary School 25th Anniversary puzzle as part of
class bonding.</p>
<p>The road race was a great opportunity to foster teamwork with my classmates.
I found the road race beneficial as it gets me to do some exercise. Even
though there were some setbacks, the road race taught me the joy of participating
and trying our best together which is what truly matters regardless of
the final outcome.

<p>The Road Race 2024 was an exhilarating event for my friends and me. Although
it was a tiring day, we created lots of memories together and bonded. This
event not only provided a thrilling experience for all participants, but
also offered numerous benefits to the students. It promoted physical fitness,
fostered a sense of community, and encouraged a healthy competitive spirit.
I hope the school will hold such events again in the near future!
