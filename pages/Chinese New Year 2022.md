As in previous years,<br> the Secondary 4 and 5 students shared the festive joy<br> by bundling the foodstuff donated by our school<br> population into attractive hampers for the residents <br>in Bukit Panjang.<br><br>The pre-recorded CNY Concert showcased the <br>performances of the various performing arts groups in <br>our school. The entire performance, including the lion<br> dance, was staged by the students and teachers of <br>the school.  The lion dance troupe comprised a few of<br> our Secondary 2 and 3 students who spent several <br>afternoons learning the instruments and the lion<br> dance movements.<br><br>Mr Jacobe Lim, Ms Karen, Mr Shamsul, Mr Andrew<br> and Mr Ng Kian Hong, our teachers, rendered a<br> melodious song. Mr Sam Soo, the teacher astrologer <br>of the day, shared the Chinese zodiac forecast for<br> 2022 with the school.<br><br>The highlight of this year's celebration was the God <br>of Fortune played by our Vice- Principal, Mr Phor.<br> He visited all the classes to wish them good fortune<br> and health. Both teachers and students were <br>pleasantly surprised when they saw the God of <br>Fortune walk into the classrooms.| ![](/images/cny%202022%201.jpg)<br><br>![](/images/cny%202022%202.jpg)<br><br>![](/images/cny%202022%203.jpg) |
