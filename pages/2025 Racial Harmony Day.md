as a harmonious and multicultural society, built on the rich diversity
of cultures and the collective efforts of all in fostering social cohesion.</p>

<p>Racial harmony is important to me as it allows me to learn about the different
cultures in Singapore and helps me bond with my peers. I can share my own
culture with them, which helps strengthen our bonds.</p>
