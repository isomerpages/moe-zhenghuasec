|Camp Fearless 2023|
|--|
| Our secondary 1 students experienced a 3-day, 1-night orientation camp. Conducted by our student councillors, students enjoyed camping activities like outdoor cooking, a nature hike, mass dance, and to top it off, a campfire. |
|The most memorable part of Camp Fearless was when I got to bond with my friends and work together with them during the camp! The outdoor cooking was my favourite part! <br><br>Lee Zi Xin Lidya (1G)|
