### Lunar New Year Hamper Giving 2017

This Lunar New Year, the school had the privilege of having Mr Liang Eng Hwa, Adviser to Zhenghua Grassroots Organisations, grace our Hamper Giving occasion on 4 Feb to residents of Bukit Panjang. All food items were donated by our students and their families, and all students spent time last week to wrap and decorate these items into lovely hampers for the residents. In addition to the hampers, we also gave out goodie bags filled with other useful food items. Many of our PSG members, current students and ex-students came by specially to help in the distribution of these hampers and goodie bags too!  We are happy to be part of this effort to bring some festive cheer to some of the needy families in Bukit Panjang during this Lunar New Year.
