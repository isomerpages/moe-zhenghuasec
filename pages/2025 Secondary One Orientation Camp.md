<p>Zenith is the name of the secondary orientation camp 2025, chosen for
its meaning of reaching peak success. The cohort bonded through outdoor
cooking and flag making, with the highlight being the mass dance performance
for parents during the camp's finale campfire.</p>

<br>The most memorable part of Camp Zenith for me was on the second day, when
we played tag, hunted for the graduation bear, and tried outdoor cooking.
During the bear hunt, we had to solve riddles, which made it both chaotic
and fun as everyone eagerly shouted out answers. I really enjoyed the experience,
especially the way we cheered and encouraged each other throughout the
game.</p>

<p>The highlight of the camp for me was the campfire on the last day, where
our entire cohort danced together in joy. It was a special moment that
brought us all together, filled with laughter and fun. I made new memories
as we entered a new year, a new school, and formed new friendships. This
camp was meaningful because it gave us the chance to learn each otherâ€™s
names and hobbies, helping us bond and connect.</p>

<p>The finale was definitely the highlight for me. It was an unforgettable
experience, especially as I got to share the moment with my mother. The
NCC seniors amazed us with a drone show set to the song "Die with a Smile,"
and the whole Secondary One cohort sang along together. After the drone
performance, my class was the first to perform, dancing our hearts out
to "Last Friday Night." We had so much fun, and we felt incredibly proud
when everyone cheered for us at the end of the song.</p>
