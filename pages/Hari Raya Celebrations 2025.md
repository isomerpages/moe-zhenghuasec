<p>‘Gemilang raya’- ‘splendour of eid’ - A grand celebration of music, dance
and culture that showcases the beauty of hari raya traditions. Through
the celebration, we aim to create an in-depth understanding of the culture
and tradition of Hari Raya celebration and to foster the value of togetherness
and gratitude and inculcate the Zhenghua spirit.</p>

<p>For the recent Hari Raya concert, I was given the opportunity to be the
deejay for the pre-morning assembly programme together with my friend,
Maira where we presented a selection of Hari Raya songs and shared their
cultural significance with the school. Prior to the sharing, we wrote our
script and practised how to deliver the script together. I am thankful
to be given the rare opportunity to be a part of this celebration. I would
gladly do it again if I was given the opportunity to.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Being a deejay for the Hari Raya celebration was a meaningful and exciting
experience for me. I was proud to be part of the celebration and to contribute
in a unique way. What made it even more special was getting to do it with
my friend, Adreana. Together, we shared Hari Raya songs with the whole
school and gave short explanations about each song. I was amazed to see
how music could bring people together and create such a joyful, festive
mood. I am truly grateful for the opportunity and happy that I got to share
a part of my culture with everyone. If I ever get the chance to speak or
present again like this, I wouldn’t hesitate to take it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Hari Raya concert at Zhenghua Secondary was a vibrant and meaningful
celebration of Malay culture. I enjoyed the lively performances, traditional
music, and festive atmosphere. It was heartwarming to see our school community
come together in appreciation and respect. I learnt more about the values
of forgiveness, unity, and joy.&nbsp;</p>
