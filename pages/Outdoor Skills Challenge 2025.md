<p>Zhenghua Secondary is proud to present our Learning for Life Programme
(LLP) signature programme, the Outdoor Skills Challenge, which is held
biannually. To support the character and leadership development of our
students through outdoor education, students will have the opportunity
to experience a uniquely curated outdoor skills challenge at each level.
The challenge is designed as an inter-class competition, where every class
member must participate in at least one station.</p>

<p>We had to work together as a class to overcome different kinds of obstacles.
During the challenges, we weren't able to figure out how to solve them
at first, but after discussing and working together, we came up with solutions
and managed to overcome them. It's important to work together with others,
as it's almost impossible to succeed if we work alone. It is also important
to persevere despite facing multiple challenges.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed the opportunity to foster bonds with my classmates as
well as the excitement of competing against other classes. The biggest
challenge I faced was being unable to pitch the tent properly and light
the fire. I was stressed and impatient, but I reminded myself to stay calm
and work well with my teammates. I learned to be more patient with my classmates,
and I think I can apply this in the future.</p>

<p>My favourite part of the Outdoor Skills Challenge was when my friends
and I went around the school to find AEDs on level 1. It was really fun
because we felt like we were on a treasure hunt. The biggest challenge
I faced was performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on a dummy.
We had to locate the heart and perform CPR, which was quite tiring since
we had to push really hard. Although it was the toughest challenge I had
ever faced, it was an eye-opening experience because I got to try things
that I have never done before.&nbsp;</p>
