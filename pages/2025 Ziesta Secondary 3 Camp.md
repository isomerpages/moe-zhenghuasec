<p>The Secondary 3 Outdoor Expedition develops leadership, resilience, and
teamwork through a student-led outdoor camp experience. Over nine weeks,
students plan and manage a 4-day, 3-night expedition from logistics to
activity coordination, taking full ownership of the process for outdoor
activities like trip planning, outdoor cooking, and tent pitching.</p>

<p>Throughout this camp, I faced many challenges. However, with the support
of my ICs, classmates, and teachers, I was able to persevere and lead the
class well as an OIC. The camp helped me grow both as a leader and as a
person, building my confidence and leadership skills. It was a challenging
yet unforgettable experience that has left a lasting impact on me.</p>

<p>I learnt that communication is important, especially when conflicts arise.
Choosing to remain silent or distant can worsen misunderstandings. As leaders,
it is important to stay calm and avoid making decisions in anger.</p>
