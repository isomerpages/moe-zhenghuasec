|Awards Day 2023 took place on 5 May 2023. It was a simple yet significant occasion to celebrate the success of last year's graduates. It was the first Awards Day where guests and parents were invited. ![](/images/Camp%20Fearless%20Campfire.jpeg)|
|![](/images/Bonding%20with%20friends.jpeg)The most memorable part of Camp Fearless was when I got to bond with my friends and work together with them during the camp! The outdoor cooking was my favourite part! <br><br>Lee Zi Xin Lidya (1G)|
|![](/images/Outdoor%20Cooking.jpg)The dance and the outdoor cooking were the most memorable activities during Camp Fearless as they were fun and it helped us to get together and learn new things such as dancing and basic cooking skills!<br><br>Muhammad Aqil Mukmin Bin Muhammad Firdaus (1D) |
|![](/images/Bonding%20with%20friends%202.jpeg)What I found memorable about Camp Fearless was how everyone, no matter seniors or juniors, got along so well. Futhermore, bonding with everyone was very fun; no one was left out and everyone had a great time!<br><br>Huma Aymen Arshad (Student Councillor, 2H) |
|![](/images/Camp%20Fearless%201.jpeg)The most memorable part about Camp Fearless was the campfire finale. During the camp, i felt joyful to be with my fellow camp committee members because we had so much fun singing and dancing together. It was definitely great spending time together with the people i've been working hard with for the past two months. This was a pleasant experience and I hope that I can work with the camp committee again for other projects or events!<br><br>Nur Aliesha Sabrina Binte Azreen (Camp Committee, 3D)|
|![](/images/Camp%20Fearless%202.jpeg)The camp was very memorable. It was a new experience for me as our campfire back then was virtual. I enjoyed the atmosphere as we sang and danced. I hope to be able to have more of such experiences soon!<br><br> Chew Bing Heng Elmer (Student Councillor, 4A)
