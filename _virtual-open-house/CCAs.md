**Choir** [_(back to top)_](https://zhenghuasec.moe.edu.sg/2022-virtual-open-house/#top)

Under the directorship of Ms. Tan Jing Yi, the award-winning Zhenghua Secondary School Choir has performed a wide range of choral music from historical periods to the latest pop hits. While it has been difficult for the choristers to showcase their prowess due to Covid restrictions, this year saw the return of live performances! Thanks to weekly sessions where members used music and games to remember the theory and practical aspects of chorale singing, Zhenghua choristers effortlessly serenaded the school with a medley of National Day songs during the annual concert and led the school in the finale segment. Choir looks forward to putting up more musical performances to engage and inspire their audiences in the years ahead!



**Dance** [_(back to top)_](https://zhenghuasec.moe.edu.sg/2022-virtual-open-house/#top)

Dance Club members are a team of energetic youth who find joy in expressing their thoughts and feelings through choreographed and freestyle dance moves. All members are committed to giving their best to the Club and that is key to us obtaining the various accolades over the years.

Apart from developing technical dance skills in both Streetdance and Malay Contemporary Dance, our dance programme includes performing for various school and public performances and competitions, creating self-choreographed routines as well as participating in learning journeys to watch and appreciate live and online performances of other dance companies. In addition, opportunities for leadership development are also available as our dancers can take up different leadership roles such as Executive Committee members of the Club, Dance Captains and Level Leaders. 

Dance Club is proudly helmed by celebrated dance instructors Mr Osman Abdul Hamid and Mr Alif Aircho.



**Handbells** [_(back to top)_](https://zhenghuasec.moe.edu.sg/2022-virtual-open-house/#top)

This year, our members had more opportunities to perform and showcase their skills. For example, this was the first time that the Handbell Ensemble took part in the Hong Kong International Handbell Olympics through a video of the ensemble playing the song “Laudation”. The Handbell members also performed for the National Day concert in school and played a rousing rendition of “Di Tanjong Katong” to great applause! Last but not least, the Handbell Ensemble will be collaborating with other Handbell teams and will perform in a year-end concert organised by our instructor, Mr Myren Mak.


**Drama** [_(back to top)_](https://zhenghuasec.moe.edu.sg/2022-virtual-open-house/#top)

Drama Club began the year by exploring the art of performative poetry - creating poems of their own and acting them out. Weekly creative sessions built up to video productions that were featured on the school’s Instagram page during English and Literature Week. In June, the Exco organized a Graduation party with the theme of “Movie Characters” and the Club finally had a chance to let their hair down and give thanks to their seniors – all while dressed as their favourite movie characters! Finally, in August, the club had the opportunity to perform their first live skit in school since the Covid restrictions. They performed a skit written by local playwright, Haresh Sharma entitled ‘History, Who’s Story’ and held their own quite well, being back in the limelight again.



**Drums Ensembles** [_(back to top)_](https://zhenghuasec.moe.edu.sg/2022-virtual-open-house/#top)

Zhenghua’s Drums Ensembles, also known as Sound Propagation, continues contributing to the community by taking part in a National Day Carnival in conjunction with Bukit Timah PAssionArts. The event was organized by Bukit Timah CC for Singapore’s 57th National Day celebration and held at Clementi Firefly Park.  
  
Our drummers showcased their talents to the public and promoted multiculturalism through percussion music. It was a memorable experience and a good opportunity for our drummers to boost their confidence as this was their first national public event since the pandemic’s safety measures. Testament to our strong bonds across the years, our alumni members even joined in the fun to hype up the event with their rousing performance!

For the Hari Raya concert, our drummers played the angklung to a classic tune of “Selamat Hari Raya”. This pre-recorded performance not only showcased the senior drummers with their drumming skills but also allowed the Secondary 1 and 2 members to showcase their talents in playing ethnic instruments. We hope to produce more multi-ethnic percussion performances that highlight the richness of our multi-racial, multicultural nation.


**Band** [_(back to top)_](https://zhenghuasec.moe.edu.sg/2022-virtual-open-house/#top)

Zhenghua Secondary Concert Band aims to be the CCA for all budding musicians who want to learn how to play band instruments. We are an inclusive band that welcomes all regardless of their musical backgrounds. To build confidence and performance ability, band members have opportunities to perform regularly in various school-based concerts and external events and competitions.  

Beyond musical proficiency, the band also aims to shape the character of our members by inculcating values like resilience, humility, empathy, integrity and discipline. We believe in empowering our members by getting them involved in planning and organizing events to allow them opportunities to exercise leadership and organizational skills.


**Scouts** [_(back to top)_](https://zhenghuasec.moe.edu.sg/2022-virtual-open-house/#top)

With the easing of restrictions, Zhenghua Scouts could finally resume a myriad of experiential activities. In weekly sessions, Scouts honed their skills in orienteering and pioneering. The latter was put to good use during the annual Group Camp, where they pitched tents using advanced knotting, to shelter against the rain during outdoor cooking. Scouts also participated in the Diamond Jubilee Challenge and Job Week – both of which served to instil an appreciation of the dignity of labour. To further inculcate a sense of active citizenry, Scouts went for a learning journey to the Asian Civilisations Museum to deepen their understanding of rich cultures, and further honed their First Aid and Kayaking skills through courses.

The Scout unit also had the honour of participating in Zhenghua’s marching contingent for the National Day Parade, under the leadership of SPL Chan Jia Le Marcus, who was selected as the Parade Commander. Scouts across all levels trained tirelessly to march in formation and were proud to have put up a seamless performance in front of the school.


**Red Cross** [_(back to top)_](https://zhenghuasec.moe.edu.sg/2022-virtual-open-house/#top)

This has been an exciting year for Zhenghua’s Red Cross Youth Unit, as our cadets got to take part in numerous events and competitions. With our cadets’ hard work and dedication, our unit received stellar results, with the most note-worthy being the Overall Champion Team for the nationwide Trailblazer Championship this year. Another highlight for the unit was being able to take part in our school’s National Day Parade, after not being able to do so for the past few years. This also meant that none of us had prior experience but with the guidance of our Volunteer Instructors and our sheer determination, we did ourselves proud and executed the parade to the best of our ability. We certainly hope to get involved in even more in-person events soon so that our cadets can cultivate the core Red Cross values of compassion, passion and professionalism for the service of mankind.


**NCC (Air)** [_(back to top)_](https://zhenghuasec.moe.edu.sg/2022-virtual-open-house/#top)

NCC (Air) provides unique experiences for our cadets with programmes such as the Aeromodelling module, where cadets learn about the fundamentals of flight in order to construct their own gliders and fly drones! Cadets also strengthen their understanding of the vocations and frameworks by which the RSAF operates as they go through their Bronze, Silver and Gold Wing Proficiency courses. 

Additionally, NCC(Air) cadets look forward to military training experiences provided by military personnel through programs such as Camp Forge, Senior Specialist Leadership Course, SAR21 marksmanship training and even flight simulator training at SAF and RSAF training facilities. Students are also nurtured to be leaders through leadership modules designed by teachers to prepare them to take on leadership roles and lead the unit.


**NPCC** [_(back to top)_](https://zhenghuasec.moe.edu.sg/2022-virtual-open-house/#top)

2022 was definitely an exciting year as NPCC activities slowly returned to normalcy. Our unit sent a team to the first E-CSI Competition 2022 where they tried to investigate and solve a crime from a crime scene presented online to them. After a 2 years hiatus, we also had our Unit Bonding Day with outdoor communal cooking activities. It was a good experience to foster camaraderie and teamwork among the cadets. Laser Tag was also organized as an enrichment programme for our cadets to strengthen their communication and grow stronger, both physically and mentally. 

The unit is proud of SI Charlotte Ong and SSgt Mohd Elfrian Abdullah for achieving the NPCC-SPF Award. We thank our alumni, Seetoh Kai Jin and Tan Junqi, who have returned to serve as Cadet Inspectors mentoring the newly appointed cadet leaders for the unit.


**ODAC** [_(back to top)_](https://zhenghuasec.moe.edu.sg/2022-virtual-open-house/#top)

2022 has been a much more exciting year for ODAC! Members felt liberated as they resumed full-scale interactive activities such as roller-blading, outdoor cooking and kite-flying. The club also welcomed the return of the Greendale Adventure Race and Gecko (G.A.R.an.G.) competition, where members could put their orienteering and map-reading skills to the test in order to successfully complete challenges during the race. Being able to work together as a team and competing with teams from other schools was definitely a refreshing experience, and one that the club looks forward to in the coming years!


**Netball** [_(back to top)_](https://zhenghuasec.moe.edu.sg/2022-virtual-open-house/#top)

The girls were eager and excited to play again after a two-year break! They trained hard to adapt quickly to the new formats of matches and showed resilience to continue striving despite the challenges that they faced, such as when fellow players were down due to Covid. Although the teams could not proceed past the heats in the National School Games, it was truly heartwarming to see them encouraging each other. They will continue to learn from their mistakes, work hard and show their strengths again in upcoming competitions.


**Volleyball** [_(back to top)_](https://zhenghuasec.moe.edu.sg/2022-virtual-open-house/#top)

With the relaxation of safe management measures, our teams were able to participate in the National Schools Games again. While it was difficult pivoting back to grueling training, our players played their best against strong opponents and amassed a mix of victories and losses. Outgoing team captain Julieana (4E4) reminds the team to “Never stop trying as practice is the key to success” while incoming captain Abia (3E3) also hopes that the team remembers losses are part of a learning journey too and that the team should not regret!


**Basketball** [_(back to top)_](https://zhenghuasec.moe.edu.sg/2022-virtual-open-house/#top)

The return to face-to-face matches after a 2-year break was daunting for many but the Basketball boys took up the challenge bravely and tried their best against tough opponents. Learning from each loss, the boys managed to close the margins between the scores, improve their stamina and remembered to lean into their tempo and team strategies to lead the games more. The team looks forward to training together to hone their skills for more formidable performances in the future. After all coming together is only the beginning; keeping together is progress and working together will ensure continued success!


**Sports Club** [_(back to top)_](https://zhenghuasec.moe.edu.sg/2022-virtual-open-house/#top)

It was an exciting and joyful year for the Sports Club in 2022. Our students participated in a Bowling workshop, learning the tips and biomechanics of Two-handed bowling at Bukit Batok Westwood bowl. They also underwent two weeks of the ‘Game for Life’ package, where they learnt about the values of sports that transcend beyond the sporting arena. 

Sports Club is looking forward to including Hockey as part of our programme, in addition to the wide array of sports we already have such as Tchoukball, Touch Rugby, and Mini-Tennis.

This year, our Sports Club also saw Zhenghua Secondary School being represented at swimming for the first time. Gavin Tan Tzi Rui (2F) represented the school at the National Schools Swimming Championship. He came in 3rd in the 100-metre Butterfly event and clocked a Personal Best at his 100-metre freestyle, coming in 6th.

Zhenghua was also represented in Golf for the first time by Nefertera Rose David (1G) at the National School Games. It was the first time that she played at the national level and she displayed much grit in each game that lasted about 7 hours each day without a break. Nefertera ranked 10th out of 11 players and will continue to strive to greater heights in the years ahead!


**Soccer**  [_(back to top)_](https://zhenghuasec.moe.edu.sg/2022-virtual-open-house/#top)

With the highly anticipated National School Games resuming this year, our team of footballers put in hard work and challenged themselves to keep fit. Though it was daunting to return to the intense competitions, the boys readied themselves and adapted very well to the game play. The rare chance of having a match to play at home ground boosted the team’s morale and motivated them to do better in subsequent games. It was also heartwarming to see the boys conduct themselves in a commendable fashion on and off pitch, such as players willingly stepping up to play in positions that they were not familiar with, and experienced players easing the younger ones into the game. These moments of sportsmanship and resilience are a strong testament to the character and unity of the team that will continue to work hard and bring Zhenghua Football to greater heights!


**AV Club** [_(back to top)_](https://zhenghuasec.moe.edu.sg/2022-virtual-open-house/#top)

Covid-19 has challenged our CCA in many ways, but that did not stop our club members from learning and honing their audio-visual skills. In the first semester, events still had to be run synchronously online as the entire school community watched on. Our members proficiently coordinated between live and pre-produced videos for broadcast, allowing the virtual events to proceed without a hitch. Through these experiences, we learnt how to respond to unforeseen challenges swiftly, work as a cohesive team and built on our capacities in event and stage management. 

Later in the year, we were able to tap on these new strengths to support large-scale school events like Urban Challenge, National Day and Teachers Day Celebrations where we challenged ourselves to do live-streaming coupled with synchronous audio-visual support for various venues.


**Art Club** [_(back to top)_](https://zhenghuasec.moe.edu.sg/2022-virtual-open-house/#top)

ZSS Art Club has been growing from strength to strength across the years. This year, we accepted our largest intake of 55 budding artists across all levels! Our members hone their skills in our signature Ceramics Workshop, where they gain mastery of various handbuilding techniques to build clay sculptures, teapots and other organic forms. In addition, they are given opportunities to participate in competitions and projects. Zylia (4E3), Jing Ting (3E2), Melinda (3E2), Insyirah (3T1) and Ayrah (1G) designed 5 types of meaningful postcards based on our school values, that were then distributed schoolwide for their peers to write gratitude notes to their fellow friends, teachers and family.


**Library Club** [_(back to top)_](https://zhenghuasec.moe.edu.sg/2022-virtual-open-house/#top)

We were excited that we could resume in-person library activities this year. For Valentine’s Day, we put a twist to our popular Blind Date with a Book event and brought our eReads kiosk to the canteen so that students could have a blind date with ebooks instead!  

Our New Books Launch continued to be a hit with our top readers, garnering many favourable comments from our readers who had first dibs on the books that have yet to hit the shelves.

This year was also the first time that we managed to set up class libraries in all our Secondary 1 to 3 classes. This was complemented with a friendly level competition to see which class would have borrowed the most books at the end of the year. We are heartened to see our students reading widely and contributing to a positive school culture of reading in Zhenghua!



**Infocomm Club** [_(back to top)_](https://zhenghuasec.moe.edu.sg/2022-virtual-open-house/#top)

Infocomm Club is a dynamic CCA where members get to learn and hone new skills. These range from storyboarding, filming, to directing and editing original works. Through the pre-production to post-production stages of videography, students gain opportunities to be more adept and professional in the various roles they play and tasks they undertake from behind the camera to the screen. Students work collaboratively through effective communication and cohesive teamwork and take turns to lead and direct, which build up soft skills too!
