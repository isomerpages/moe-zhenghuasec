**Future of Transportation**

Guided by the “Future of Transportation” theme, the Tier 1 programme for Secondary One allows students to manipulate the mBot through block-based programming. As for the Secondary Two level, students learn to plan for logistics supply in a metropolitan city and use Maqueen robots and drones to carry out the delivery tasks through team activities. 

**STEM Day** 

The Tier 2 programme, such as our STEM Day, is interest-based and STEM related. STEM Day was part of our post-exam activity where our Industrial Partner A\*STAR, and vendors conducted workshops and learning journeys for students to learn more about STEM related careers. Mathematics, Science and the Craft & Technology departments were also involved in conducting the STEM workshops for our students.

**Learning for Life Programme** 

Our Learning for Life Programme (LLP)  is Outdoor Education for Character and Leadership Development. The LLP aims to provide students with varied outdoor experiences and equip them with the competencies and attitudes to enjoy the outdoors. During their time in the school, students have the opportunity to experience the following skills:

*   First Aid 
*   Orienteering 
*   Kayaking 1 Star Award
*   Planning and implementing class camp
*   Outdoor cooking
*   Pitching tents 

Students had an enriching and fulfilling experience in the non-residential camp. They whipped out fresh meals for themselves and their teachers, bonded  over a plate of pasta and sweet fluffy pancakes. In addition, they had the opportunity to play sports such as archery. Led by their class leaders, the campers gamely attempted  the various challenges and activities during the camp.

**Character & Citizenship Education** 

The school’s Character, Leadership, and Citizenship (CLC) Programme aims to develop principled and future-ready leaders through a wide range of authentic and meaningful learning experiences.

Responding to the needs of youths impacted by Covid-19, the school has continued to grow our Family Education programme with another cohort of Secondary 1 students participating in the FamChamps Be.Live Conference. We have also customised and implemented a series of mental well-being lessons to equip students with the necessary knowledge and skills to be resilient individuals and effective peer supporters. 

We continue to assist low-income families in our neighbourhood; this is done in partnership with Zhenghua RC. Moreover, representatives from ten community service organisations spoke to our students about their work which helped them to craft and implement better VIA projects.

**Student Leadership**

Student Leadership in Zhenghua Secondary uses the Leadership Challenge Model (LCM) and the five practices of LCM to guide and nurture our students into future-ready leaders and to face the challenges of this ever changing world. The five practices are:

*   Model the Way
*   Enable Others to Act
*   Encourage the Heart
*   Challenge the Process
*   Inspire a Shared Vision

Student Leadership creates opportunities for all students in Zhenghua Secondary to be a leadership in various aspects and levels. From the very fundamental of self-leadership (taking care and responsibility for oneself), to peer-leadership (class leaders and CCA leaders) and at the pinnacle of thought-leadership (student councils and EXCO), Student Leadership aims and hopes that all students will carry these varying learning experiences beyond their secondary school life. Students’ Council also provides training such as external training in event planning, mentoring and exposing students to organising various school-wide events such as Teachers’ Day and the annual Secondary One Orientation Camp. There is also opportunities provided for Students’ Leaders to work with community through VIA and external speakers’ sharing.

Student Leadership is an ongoing journey that extends beyond the academic aspect and we hope that all Zhenghua students will: Being a Leader, for others, for oneself, for now and for future.

**English** 

Through our signature programmes, the English and Literature department aims to unlock our students’ hidden potential and encourage the rich exploration of language in innovative ways beyond the classroom. Every year, students participate in the annual EL and Humanities Week, where they try their hand at blackout poetry, English puzzles and more, to explore the language in fun and immersive ways. Our debate, drama and creative writing workshops help to foster rich learning in students as they delve into different facets of language learning, while also cultivating their various talents and interests. To further stretch them beyond their comfort zones, the department also supports students as they participate in competitions such as the Orator’s Trophy, National Schools Literature Festival and Write for Kindness competition. All these and more await you in our English and Literature classrooms!

**Mother Tongue** 

In MTL department, students will be enriched by our Signature Programmes with task-based, ICT infused learning programmes specially designed for students for every level. Some of these include Pang Sua Pond project work and Vbolg, drama appreciation and writing workshops. We expose students to cultural activities through festive celebrations and cultural workshops such as the celebrations of Chinese New Year and Hari Raya,, Mother Tongue Fortnight  to ignite their interest and love for their culture. In 2020, our secondary 1 students have the opportunity to learn the language and culture of other ethnic groups in SIngapore via our Conversational Chinese and Malay (CCM) enrichment workshops. 

To prepare students with the challenges of a globalised world, our secondary 3 students will have overseas immersion trips to places like Beijing and ASEAN countries. Students are given the opportunity to stretch their potential through our Stretch Programmes where they are exposed to and try their hand at journalism, Chinese history etc. An exciting journey awaits here at ZSS MTL department!

**Science** 

Science projects and learning journeys are planned to equip lower secondary students with knowledge and skills which will enable them to deeply appreciate and understand the world around them. Examples include a Science Research project, Communicating Science Poster Designs, and learning journeys to SEA Aquarium, Botanic Gardens and the Singapore Zoo.

Game-based Learning, Task-based Learning and Team-based Learning are some pedagogies adopted to meaningfully engage the students, develop their collaborative learning skills, communication skills and skills for self-directed learning, as well as make learning fun!

**Mathematics** 

iDiscuss is one of our department’s signature programmes where the Secondary 3 students get to discuss real world problems with groupmates consisting of members across two classes. They explore different video meeting apps that allow them to communicate and solve authentic mathematical tasks. This allows them to have a feel of the real world which is made even more relevant in times of uncertainties like the Covid-19 situation. Similarly, Inter-class Mathematics Competition is another signature programme where all students adopt the Polya Problem Solving framework to solve challenging problems in Mathematics. It is a spin-off from the bi-weekly problem-based learning tasks where students get to apply the Mathematical concepts that they have learnt to solve real world problems. They would also need to reflect on the given solutions. Students who are interested to stretch their minds are encouraged to participate in the Singapore Mathematics Project Festival (SMPF) where they carry out and present innovative work in mathematics. Peer-tutoring is another signature programme for the lower secondary level which involves students from the higher levels (Sec 3 & Sec 2) tutoring the lower secondary students. Lastly, the use of apps help students to learn through the infusion of technology. For instance, as students wind the digital clock, they can visually see the number of times that the hour and minute hands are perpendicular to each other over a 24-hour period. Students can then focus on extending the problem or generalise their solution.

**Humanities** 

In Zhenghua Secondary School, the students learn through our Humanities signature programme which is E3 (Explore, Engage, Experience!). Our students are given the opportunity to use Minecraft to learn about Singapore’s history. Through the use of Minecraft, students explored virtual environments that have been lost in time and create ancient relics found in the past, such as the Singapore Stone. The study of Humanities also takes place beyond the confines of the classroom where students embark on Overseas Cultural Immersion Trips, Learning Journeys, Historical and Geographical Investigations. In 2019, our students went to Taipei to explore the city’s rich historical and geographical landscape. The URA, Macritchie Reservoir, the Singapore River, Changi Jewel and the Singapore Sports Hub are some of the local attractions that our students have visited to learn more about History and Geography.

**Craft & Technology** 

**Learning Is Fun & Engaging (L.I.F.E) @ZSSC&T**

**Craft & Technology** is a compulsory module for the lower secondary students. It comprises of 3 subjects. In **Design & Technology (D&T)**, students get to experience creating prototypes using the Design Process. For **Food and Consumer Education (FCE**), students learn to appreciate and apply culinary skills and consumerism to benefit the family and community. In **Art**, students will be able to express their talents by producing interesting art pieces and sculptures as well as harness the use of ICT in their creations. The big idea is to develop critical thinking and innovation in their design ideas, sound meal planning, and creative art pieces.

**Craft & Technology** offers opportunities for students to develop 21st Century Competencies (21CC). Approaches are student-centred, using applied learning based on the use of authentic real-life scenarios that are relevant in today’s context. A range of both Formative and Summative assessments are used to help students become self-directed learners as it creates awareness of their progress and provides feedback on their level of mastery of content, knowledge and skills.

So, dive in and enjoy the hands-on learning journey with us!

**Aesthetics** 

The Aesthetics programme seeks to empower our students with the knowledge, skills, and disposition to appreciate and participate in music. 

Musical understanding is developed through listening, responding, creating, and performing. The learning of musical elements and concepts through various musical activities provide students with the means to understand and engage with music across genres and local and global cultures.
