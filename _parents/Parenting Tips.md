### Parenting Tips

#### HOW THE SCHOOL WORKS WITH THE PARENTS:

##### Evidence-Based Parenting (EBP) Programme

Zhenghua Secondary School has embarked on the Evidence-Based Parenting (EBP) Programme in 2019. The EBP Programme, which is also known as Positive Parenting Programme (Triple P), is a programme supported by the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF). Through a series of parenting seminars, individual or group consultations, the programme serves to enhance the knowledge, skills and confidence of parents for them to manage or prevent behavioural, emotional and developmental problems in children. Under a study by MSF, it has been shown that the EBP Programme is effective in reducing parenting stress, anxiety and/or negative emotional states, and the child’s difficult behaviour.

Do keep a lookout for the latest updates on the seminars and related activities which will be organized by the school under this programme.

##### Meet-the-Parents Sessions

The school usually holds such sessions at the end of Term 2 (May) and Term 4 (October) with the release of the semestral results. Additional sessions are also held to brief parents on level programmes.

##### Phone Calls

The form teacher and subject teachers may call parents to discuss and provide updates on the child’s performance or behaviour. It is very important to keep the school updated of any change in the phone number(s).

##### School Website

Please refer to the school website for announcements and the latest news from the school.

##### Participation in School Activities

Parents are warmly welcomed to participate in the school’s activities like Sports Day and Secondary One Campfire. Such activities create an informal setting for parents to know the school and teachers better.

Our Parent Support Group (PSG) also conducts activities and workshops throughout the year to provide bonding opportunities for our parents and their children.

##### Schoolbag.sg – Online Resource Portal

[https://www.schoolbag.sg/](https://www.schoolbag.sg/), is an online publication by the Ministry of Education (MOE) to provide parents, educators and the general public with education news, school features and tips.
